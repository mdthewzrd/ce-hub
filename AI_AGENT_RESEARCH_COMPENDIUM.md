## 1. Book Writing Agent

### Core Architecture Patterns

#### Multi-Agent Approach (Recommended)
Based on research from [A Novel Being Written in Real-Time by 10 Autonomous AI Agents](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gvn049/a_novel_being_written_in_realtime_by_10/):

**Specialized Sub-Agents:**
1. **Research Agent** - Builds world foundations and gathers context
2. **Structure Agent** - Maintains consistency across chapters
3. **Character Agent** - Tracks character traits, appearance, behaviors
4. **Editor Agent** - Quality control and coherence validation
5. **Drafting Agent** - Generates actual prose

#### Character Consistency System

**Research Finding:** [Multi-Agent Based Character Simulation for Story Writing](https://aclanthology.org/2025.in2writing-1.9.pdf) (T. Yu et al., 2025)

> Stories generated by their system maintain **better character consistency and narrative coherence** through dedicated character simulation agents.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
# Character Tracking Data Structure
character_profile = {
    "name": "Character Name",
    "personality_traits": ["trait1", "trait2", "trait3"],
    "appearance": {"key": "value"},
    "speech_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
    "background_story": "...",
    "relationships": {"other_character": "relationship_type"},
    "chapter_appearances": [1, 3, 5, 8],
    "character_arc_development": {
        "initial_state": "...",
        "transformation_goal": "...",
        "current_state": "..."
    }
}
```

### Memory Management Strategies

**Primary Challenge:** Context Window Limitations

**Source:** [The Ultimate Guide to LLM Memory](https://medium.com/@sonitanishk2003/the-ultimate-guide-to-llm-memory-from-context-windows-to-advanced-agent-memory-systems-3ec106d2a345)

> Context windows are the "single most important constraint" dictating LLM decisions.

**Solutions:**

1. **Agentic Memory (Anthropic Approach)**
   - Source: [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)
   - Technique: Agents regularly write notes persisted to memory outside the context window
   - Implementation: File-based structured storage

2. **Hierarchical Summarization**
   - Chapter-level summaries
   - Scene-level summaries
   - Character relationship maps
   - Plot thread tracking

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Context**
   - Vector database of previous chapters
   - Semantic search for relevant context
   - Dynamic context assembly based on current writing task

### Chain-of-Thought for Long-Form Writing

**Foundational Research:** [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) (Wei et al., 2022) - **23,884 citations**

**Application to Book Writing:**
1. **Plot CoT:** "What are the consequences of this event for later chapters?"
2. **Character CoT:** "How would this character's backstory influence their reaction?"
3. **Consistency CoT:** "Does this scene contradict established facts?"

**Agent Prompt Template:**
```
You are a book writing agent. Before writing each scene, think through:

1. PLOT CONSISTENCY: What plot threads are active? How does this scene advance them?
2. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Which characters appear? What are their current states? How would they react?
3. WORLD CONSISTENCY: What world rules apply? Have they been established?
4. NARRATIVE COHERENCE: How does this scene connect to previous and future scenes?

After thinking through these aspects, write the scene.
```

2. **Implementation Options:**
   - **AWS Transcribe** - Production-ready, speaker identification
   - **Speechmatics** - Real-time diarization with LiveKit integration
   - **Deepgram** - API-level speaker diarization with timestamps
   - **OpenAI Whisper** - Community implementations for diarization

### Timestamp Preservation

**Best Practices:** [How to Fix Timestamps and Timecodes](https://gotranscript.com/blog/fix-timestamps-timecodes-auto-generated-transcripts)

**Standard Formats:**

| Format | Pattern | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **SRT** | `HH:MM:SS,mmm` | Video subtitles, editing workflows |
| **VTT** | `HH:MM:SS.mmm` | Web-based video players |
| **TXT** | `[HH:MM:SS]` | Plain text with embedded timestamps |
| **JSON** | Structured object | Machine-readable, preserves all metadata |

**Timestamp Placement Rules:**
1. Every speaker change
2. Every 30-60 seconds for continuous speech
3. At topic transitions
4. Based on customer/project requirements

**Example SRT Format:**
```srt
1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,500
[Speaker 1]: This is an example of proper SRT formatting with
milliseconds preserved for subtitle synchronization.

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
[Speaker 2]: Note the consistent timestamp format throughout
the transcript.
```

### Formatting for Book Readability

   - Preserve speaker changes on new lines
   - Include non-verbal cues when relevant ([laughs], [pauses], etc.)

2. **Punctuation & Grammar**
   - Add appropriate punctuation for readability
   - Fix obvious speech disfluencies (um, uh, repeated words)
   - Preserve emphasis and emotional tone
   - Maintain natural speech patterns

3. **Technical Terminology**
   - Research domain-specific terms before transcription
   - Preserve acronyms and industry jargon
   - Add clarification notes for obscure terms
   - Consistent capitalization of technical terms

4. **Layout & Structure**
   - Clear paragraph breaks for topic changes
   - Logical grouping of related content
