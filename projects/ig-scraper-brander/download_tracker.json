Electricity, vibration, and frequency were considered fundamental forces of life.\n\nJohn Ernst Worrell Keely proposed that matter and biology were governed by harmonic vibration. He described disease as a state of disharmony, and health as restored resonance. \n\nHis work influenced early ideas of sympathetic vibration, acoustics, and frequency-based healing, concepts that would later resurface in physics and biology under different names.\n\nGeorges Lakhovsky expanded this framework. His Multi-Wave Oscillator (MWO) was installed in hospitals and clinics throughout the U.S. and Europe. Lakhovsky showed that cells behave as oscillators and that illness reflects disrupted cellular frequencies. \n\nAfter his death in the early 1940s, MWOs were systematically removed from hospitals and his work quietly abandoned.\n\nRoyal Raymond Rife went further, developing optical microscopes capable of visualizing live microorganisms and frequency devices that reportedly destroyed pathogens without harming surrounding tissue. \n\nHis clinical successes were documented, then challenged. Lawsuits, professional pressure, and regulatory shifts ended his practice.\n\nThe turning point came with the Flexner Report, which restructured medical education. Treatments that could not be patented, electricity, vibration, frequency, were removed from curricula. \n\nPharmaceutical chemistry replaced energetic medicine.\n\nWhat was once mainstream medical science was rebranded as quackery.\n\nHistory didn\u2019t disprove electromedicine.\n\nIt erased it.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to learn what has been hidden from the modern lexicon comment \u201cBIOFIELD\u201d to sign up for the Biofield Mastery Training Program today. \n\nOn SALE for a limited time!",
