“You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop. When the soul is in alignment with its true essence, it radiates a divine light. This light is your aura - ever present, ever expanding, and always a reflection of your inner state.

When you open yourself to love, your soul becomes the sun and your aura mirrors its radiance, illuminating not only your path but the world around you.”
