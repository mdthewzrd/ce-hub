After months of creating, organizing, and curating mystical content … Open Pineal Gland Patreon is now live! 𓂀

Journey into a realm of spiritual essays, esoteric studies, PDF books, symbolism, and reflections on consciousness. 

This is where I’ll share what doesn’t always fit here, longer, deeper and more personal insights. 

Thank you for the love and energy you’ve shared along the way. Here’s to exploring deeper together.
