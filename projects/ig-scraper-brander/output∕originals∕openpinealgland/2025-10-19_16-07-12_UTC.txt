The Caduceus, with its two serpents winding around a staff, is one of the oldest symbols known to us. It’s found in ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Indian traditions, representing balance, healing, and energy flow.

The two serpents mirror the dual forces within us, masculine and feminine, light and dark, moving in harmony. In yoga this is the idea of Kundalini, the life energy that rises through the spine to awaken higher consciousness.

That’s why the symbol appears everywhere. It reminds us that real healing starts with balance inside ourselves. 🐍
