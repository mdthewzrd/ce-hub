“From birth to death, we travel a circle; know the Self, and you will see the infinite within the finite.”
- 𝙆𝙖𝙗𝙞𝙧

The Ouroboros, the serpent devouring its own tail, is one of the oldest mystical symbols. It embodies infinity, the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It reminds us that destruction and creation are never separate, but part of the same eternal flow. Every ending folds into a new beginning, and all things are bound together in one continuous circle.
