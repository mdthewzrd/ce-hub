“When the third eye awakens, duality dissolves, and the seer and the seen become one.”
- 𝙍𝙖𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙖 𝙈𝙖𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞

When the inner eye opens,
duality fades away.
The watcher and the watched
are no longer separate;
just one flowing presence.

The dance and the dancer,
the dream and the dreamer,
all merge into the same quiet knowing.
