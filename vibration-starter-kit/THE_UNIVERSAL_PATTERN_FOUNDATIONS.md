# THE UNIVERSAL PATTERN
## Harmony, Frequency, and the Hidden Architecture of Reality

---

## A Note to the Reader

You're about to encounter ideas that may challenge everything you've been taught about how reality works.

That's not because these ideas are strange or mystical. It's because **what we've been taught is incomplete**.

We've been taught that:
- Numbers are just for counting
- Music is just entertainment
- Geometry is just for shapes
- Energy and matter are separate things
- The universe is random and chaotic

But what if none of that is true? What if there's a **pattern underlying everything**—a coherent, intelligent design that structures reality from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy?

This document introduces you to that pattern.

Not as theory. Not as speculation. But as **verifiable, observable reality** that you can see for yourself.

---

## PART I: THE AWAKENING

### The Recognition That Changes Everything

Here's the recognition that changes everything:

**Reality is not random. It's designed.**

And the design follows patterns—patterns you can see, patterns you can verify, patterns that are hiding in plain sight.

This isn't about believing something on faith. It's about **opening your eyes to what's already there**.

Consider:

- **A sunflower's seeds** arrange themselves in spirals
- **A hurricane's winds** follow precise mathematical flows
- **Musical harmony** is based on simple number ratios
- **The human body** reflects geometric proportions found throughout nature

These aren't coincidences. They're clues.

They're pointing to something fundamental about how reality works.

### The Pattern That Connects Everything

Throughout this guide, we'll explore a specific pattern—a **universal pattern** that appears at every scale of reality:

**In Mathematics:** Vortex Based Mathematics reveals how numbers create geometric forms

**In Nature:** Sacred geometry shows how those forms become physical reality

**In Physics:** The unified field demonstrates how energy follows those patterns

**In Music:** Harmony shows us how mathematical ratios create beauty

**In Healing:** Frequency therapy demonstrates how vibration transforms matter

This isn't five different patterns. **It's one pattern, expressed through different domains.**

### How This Guide Works

This guide will:

1. **Show you the pattern** (so you can recognize it)
2. **Explain why it matters** (so you understand its significance)
3. **Give you exercises** (so you can verify it yourself)
4. **Connect it to your life** (so you can apply it practically)

This isn't about abstract theory. **This is about transforming how you see and interact with reality.**

## PART II: THE MATHEMATICS OF CREATION

### Beyond Calculation: Numbers as Pattern

What are numbers?

In school, we learn that numbers are tools for calculation. We learn to add, subtract, multiply, divide. We learn that numbers are quantities.

But here's what we're not taught:

**Numbers have qualities, relationships, and patterns that exist independently of what we do with them.**

The number 3 isn't just "three things." It's a principle—a way reality organizes itself.

The number 9 isn't just "nine things." It's a completion—a return to unity.

When you recognize this, mathematics transforms from a dry subject into **the language of creation itself**.

### The Number Map: A Portrait of Reality

Imagine a circle with the numbers 1 through 9 arranged around it:

```
        1
    9       2
  8           3
    7       4
        6   5
```

This isn't just an organization. It's a **map of reality**—a geometric representation of how energy, matter, and consciousness structure themselves.

From this simple arrangement, profound patterns emerge.

### The Doubling Circuit: How Creation Expands

Start at 1. Double it: 1 × 2 = 2. Draw a line from 1 to 2 on the circle.

Double again: 2 × 2 = 4. Draw a line from 2 to 4.

Double again: 4 × 2 = 8. Draw a line from 4 to 8.

Double again: 8 × 2 = 16. Reduce to single digit: 1 + 6 = 7. Draw a line from 8 to 7.

Continue:

- 7 × 2 = 14 → 1 + 4 = 5 (line from 7 to 5)
- 5 × 2 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1 (line from 5 back to 1)

The circuit is complete: **1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1**

This is the **Doubling Circuit**—a continuous loop that demonstrates how unity (1) expresses itself through increasingly complex forms while always returning to its source.

**This pattern appears throughout nature:**

- **Cell division** follows doubling patterns
- **Musical octaves** double in frequency (A at 220Hz, 440Hz, 880Hz)
- **Electromagnetic waves** follow doubling relationships
- **Crystal structures** form along doubling geometries

The doubling circuit isn't arbitrary. **It's fundamental to how the universe creates.**

### The Tripling Circuit: The Creative Spark

Now multiply by 3 instead of 2:

- 1 × 3 = 3 (line from 1 to 3)
- 3 × 3 = 9 (line from 3 to 9)
- 9 × 3 = 27 → 2 + 7 = 9 (stays at 9)

The pattern is: **1 → 3 → 9**

And here's the remarkable thing: **Nine is the completion.**

Every time you triple 9, you get 9:

- 9 × 3 = 27 → 2 + 7 = 9
- 27 × 3 = 81 → 8 + 1 = 9
- 81 × 3 = 243 → 2 + 4 + 3 = 9

This is what Nikola Tesla meant when he said: *"If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe."*

**Three (3)** is the creative spark—the initiation of movement and manifestation

**Six (6)** is the form—the structure that manifestation takes

**Nine (9)** is the completion—the return to unity

### The 3-6-9 Axis: Tesla's Key to the Universe

Tesla worked directly with electricity, magnetism, and resonance. He recognized patterns in how energy behaves.

The 3-6-9 axis is the **bridge between potential and actual, between unity and diversity**:

- **3** initiates creation (the spark)
- **6** gives it form (the structure)
- **9** completes it (the return)

This pattern appears throughout nature and technology:

- **Atoms**: 3 subatomic particles (proton, neutron, electron)
- **Time**: Past, present, future
- **Matter**: Solid, liquid, gas
- **Color**: Red, green, blue (primary light colors)
- **Electricity**: Voltage, current, resistance

**The universe operates in threes, structures in sixes, and completes in nines.**

### From Flat Map to 3D Reality: The Torus

Here's where this becomes revolutionary:

**What if this 2D number map is actually a 2D representation of a 3D object?**

The answer is the **Torus**—a donut-shaped geometric form that incorporates all the relationships of the number map into a flowing, dynamic structure.

The torus is the shape that energy takes when it flows in coherent systems:

- **Magnetic fields** around planets and stars
- **Hurricanes** and tornadoes
- **Smoke rings** and vortex rings
- **The human heart's** electromagnetic field
- **Atoms** at the quantum scale

The torus isn't just common in nature—**it's the fundamental shape of energy flow**.

### Exercise: Verify the Patterns Yourself

You don't have to believe any of this. **You can verify it yourself.**

**Exercise 1: The Doubling Circuit**

Start with 1. Keep doubling it. Reduce each result to a single digit:

- 1 × 2 = 2
- 2 × 2 = 4
- 4 × 2 = 8
- 8 × 2 = 16 → 1 + 6 = 7
- 7 × 2 = 14 → 1 + 4 = 5
- 5 × 2 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1

The pattern: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1

This pattern repeats infinitely. It never varies.

**Exercise 2: The Tripling Circuit**

Now try tripling:

- 1 × 3 = 3
- 3 × 3 = 9
- 9 × 3 = 27 → 2 + 7 = 9
- 27 × 3 = 81 → 8 + 1 = 9
- 81 × 3 = 243 → 2 + 4 + 3 = 9

No matter how many times you triple 9, you always get 9.

**Exercise 3: Find Torus Shapes**

Look for torus shapes in your environment:

- In nature (fruits, flowers, weather patterns)
- In your body (energy flow, blood circulation)
- In technology (magnetic fields, smoke rings)

The more you look, the more you'll find. **These patterns are everywhere.**

## PART III: THE GEOMETRY OF EXISTENCE

### From Number to Form

In Part II, we explored how numbers create patterns. Now we'll see how those patterns become **visible forms**—geometric shapes that structure physical reality.

This is **Sacred Geometry**—the study of universal patterns in nature.

Not "sacred" in a religious sense, but **worthy of reverence, respect, and deep contemplation**.

These patterns are sacred because they're:

1. **Universal**—found throughout nature at every scale
2. **Timeless**—existing before humans and continuing after us
3. **Fundamental**—forming the basis of all physical reality
4. **Beautiful**—possessing elegance that inspires awe
5. **Meaningful**—reflecting principles of intelligent design

### The Flower of Life: Nature's Master Pattern

The most famous pattern in sacred geometry is the **Flower of Life**—a complex geometric figure composed of multiple evenly-spaced, overlapping circles.

**How to construct it:**

1. Draw a circle
2. Draw a second circle with the same radius, centered on the first's circumference
3. Continue adding circles, each centered on the intersection points of previous circles
4. Continue until you have 19 circles forming a complete flower pattern

What emerges is beautiful in its simplicity and profound in its implications.

**The Flower of Life contains within it:**

- **The Seed of Life** (7 circles at the center)
- **The Egg of Life** (interconnected spheres)
- **Metatron's Cube** (13 circles that form all Platonic solids)
- **The Vesica Piscis** (the intersection of two circles)
- **The Tree of Life** (from Kabbalah)

Each pattern has its own significance. Together, they form a complete geometric language.

**Remarkably, this pattern appears throughout human history:**

- **Egypt**: Temple of Osiris at Abydos (3,000+ years old)
- **China**: Ancient art and architecture
- **India**: Vedic texts and temples
- **Turkey**: Ottoman architecture
- **Europe**: Medieval cathedrals

How did cultures with no contact arrive at the same pattern?

**They weren't inventing it. They were recognizing it—observing the fundamental geometry that structures reality itself.**

### Fibonacci: Nature's Counting System

If sacred geometry is the **shape** of nature's patterns, the **Fibonacci sequence** is the **count** of those patterns.

The sequence: **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...**

Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

**Where it appears in nature:**

**Plants:**
- **Sunflowers**: Seeds arrange in 34 and 55 spirals (consecutive Fibonacci numbers)
- **Pine cones**: Scales follow 8 and 13 spiral patterns
- **Pineapples**: Same Fibonacci spiral arrangement
- **Tree branches**: Often split following Fibonacci sequences

**Animals:**
- **Rabbit reproduction**: Originally modeled by Fibonacci sequence
- **Honeybees**: 1 parent, 2 grandparents, 3 great-grandparents, 5 great-great-grandparents
- **Spiral shells**: Nautilus grows in Fibonacci spirals

**Humans:**
- **Finger bones**: Length ratios follow Fibonacci
- **Facial proportions**: Various measurements relate as Fibonacci ratios
- **DNA**: Double helix is approximately 34 angstroms by 21 angstroms (Fibonacci numbers)

**Why does this pattern appear everywhere?**

The Fibonacci sequence is **the most efficient way to pack structures in space**.

When plants arrange seeds or leaves, they want to:
1. Maximize exposure to sunlight
2. Maximize packing density
3. Maintain structural stability

The Fibonacci spiral accomplishes all of this optimally.

**Nature uses the most efficient solution. And that solution is Fibonacci.**

### The Golden Ratio: Phi (Φ) — The Universal Proportion

As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the ratio between successive numbers approaches **Phi (Φ)**:

1/1 = 1
2/1 = 2
3/2 = 1.5
5/3 = 1.667
8/5 = 1.6
13/8 = 1.625
21/13 = 1.615
34/21 = 1.619
55/34 = 1.618

The exact value of Φ is **1.6180339887...**

**Phi has unique mathematical properties:**
- Φ + 1 = Φ² (phi plus one equals phi squared)
- 1/Φ = Φ - 1 (one over phi equals phi minus one)
- Φ is irrational—its decimal representation never repeats

**Phi appears throughout nature:**

- **Human body**: Navel height to total height approximates Φ
- **DNA**: Cross-section is a decagon (10-sided figure) based on Φ
- **Animal bodies**: Dolphin proportions, shell spirals, antler shapes
- **Plant growth**: Angle of growth in many plants follows Φ
- **Art and architecture**: The Parthenon, Great Pyramid, classical paintings

**Phi represents a fundamental proportion of nature**—the relationship between parts and wholes in natural systems.

### The Torus: The Shape of Energy Flow

We introduced the torus in Part II. Now let's explore why it's so fundamental.

**A torus is a donut-shaped geometric form**—but that definition doesn't capture its significance.

**Torus shapes appear throughout nature:**

- **Atoms**: Probability clouds form torus-like patterns
- **Magnetic fields**: Earth's magnetic field is a torus
- **Fruits**: Apples, tomatoes, many fruits
- **Weather**: Hurricanes and tornadoes form torus patterns
- **Water**: Vortices in draining water form torus shapes
- **Galaxies**: Many have torus-like structures
- **Human heart**: Its electromagnetic field forms a torus

**Why is the torus so fundamental?**

Because the torus is the **natural form of energy flow in a coherent system**:

1. Energy flows along the surface in spiraling patterns
2. The system continuously recirculates—nothing is lost, nothing is added
3. The form is self-stabilizing—it maintains its shape through flow
4. The center connects to the whole—everything is interconnected

**The torus is the shape of sustainable, coherent energy flow.**

Since the universe is made of energy in flow, **the torus is the fundamental shape of existence.**

### Music Creates Geometry: Cymatics

One of the most beautiful expressions of sacred geometry is the connection between sound and form.

**Cymatics** is the study of visible sound and vibration.

When you vibrate a plate covered with sand or water at specific frequencies, geometric patterns emerge:

- **Simple frequencies** create simple shapes (circles, triangles)
- **Complex frequencies** create complex shapes (Flower of Life patterns)
- **Musical intervals** create specific geometric forms

**Sound creates geometry.**

The mathematics of music becomes the sacred geometry of form.

### Exercise: See the Patterns Yourself

**Exercise 1: Draw the Flower of Life**

1. Draw a circle using a compass
2. Place your compass point on the circle's edge
3. Draw a second circle of the same radius
4. Continue drawing circles centered on intersection points
5. Complete until you have the full Flower of Life

As you draw, notice the patterns that emerge.

**Exercise 2: Find Fibonacci in Nature**

Go outside and find:
- A flower or seed head with spiral patterns
- Count the spirals in each direction
- Verify they're Fibonacci numbers (8 and 13, 13 and 21, etc.)

**Exercise 3: Measure Phi**

Measure objects in your environment:
- Books (length divided by width)
- Rooms (length divided by width)
- Furniture proportions
- Art frame proportions

You'll be surprised how often Φ appears.

## PART IV: THE PHYSICS OF EVERYTHING

### Everything is Energy

Here's a fundamental truth that modern physics confirmed but we often forget:

**Everything is energy.**

That's not metaphorical. That's literal.

- Matter is condensed energy
- Light is electromagnetic energy
- Sound is mechanical energy
- Thought is electrical energy
- Emotion is chemical and electrical energy

And because everything is energy, **everything follows the laws of energy**.

### The Unified Field: Everything is Connected

Conventional physics teaches us about four fundamental forces:

1. **Electromagnetism** (light, electricity, magnetism)
2. **Gravity** (attraction between masses)
3. **Strong Nuclear Force** (holds atomic nuclei together)
4. **Weak Nuclear Force** (radioactive decay)

These are treated as separate, with different equations.

But what if they're not separate? **What if they're different expressions of one fundamental field?**

Think of water:
- As **ice**, it's solid
- As **water**, it's liquid
- As **steam**, it's gas

Different forms, different behaviors, but all H₂O.

**What if the four forces are like ice, water, and steam?** Different expressions of one fundamental reality.

### Plasmoids: Energy Made Visible

If there's one missing piece in conventional physics, it's **plasmoids**—coherent balls of plasma energy that demonstrate unified field principles.

**A plasmoid is:**
- Spherical or toroidal in shape
- Coherent (organized, not random)
- Self-sustaining (maintains form without continuous input)
- Stable (doesn't immediately dissipate)

**Ball lightning** is the most well-known plasmoid—rare but well-documented atmospheric phenomenon.

Historically considered folklore, ball lightning is now **scientifically validated**:
- Laboratory creation confirmed
- Spectroscopic analysis shows plasma composition
- Video documentation exists
- Thousands of credible witnesses

**Ball lightning isn't folklore. It's a window into how the unified field actually works.**

### Coherence: Creating Order from Chaos

A key principle throughout unified field research is **coherence**—the quality of being organized, consistent, and harmonious.

**Examples of coherence:**
- **Laser light**: All waves in phase (coherent) vs. light bulb (incoherent)
- **Orchestra**: Playing together (coherent) vs. tuning up (incoherent)
- **Heart**: Coherent rhythm vs. arrhythmia
- **Thought**: Focused attention (coherent) vs. scattered thinking (incoherent)

**Coherent systems have remarkable properties that incoherent systems don't.**

**Living systems are fundamentally coherent:**
- The heart creates a coherent electromagnetic field
- The brain synchronizes during focus
- Cells maintain coherent communication
- DNA stores and processes information coherently

**Health is coherence. Disease is incoherence.**

### The Implications

When you understand that everything is energy and all energy is connected:

**1. You can transform reality by working with energy**
- Sound and frequency can heal
- Intention affects matter
- Coherence creates order

**2. You're not separate from the universe**
- Your bio-field connects to planetary fields
- Your thoughts affect your reality
- Your emotions affect those around you

**3. The universe is intelligent**
- Patterns are too consistent to be random
- Design is too elegant to be accidental
- Beauty is too pervasive to be meaningless

---

## PART V: THE MEDICINE OF VIBRATION

### The Foundation: Disease is Dissonance, Health is Resonance

If everything is energy and vibration, then **vibration can be used for healing.**

This is the foundation of energy medicine:

**Disease is dissonance. Health is resonance.**

When the body's vibrations are:
- **Coherent, harmonious, organized** → Health results
- **Incoherent, disharmonious, disorganized** → Disease manifests

This isn't a new idea. Ancient healing traditions have used sound, light, and frequency for millennia. Modern research is increasingly validating these approaches.

### Pythagorean Tuning: The Musical Key to Health

The ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras discovered that **musical harmony is based on mathematical ratios**:

- **Octave**: 2:1 frequency ratio (same note, higher pitch)
- **Perfect fifth**: 3:2 frequency ratio
- **Perfect fourth**: 4:3 frequency ratio

These simple whole-number ratios create the harmonies we find beautiful—and they also create **coherence in biological systems**.

**Modern research demonstrates:**
- Specific frequencies support specific biological processes
- Harmonious intervals create coherent bio-fields
- Inharmonic intervals create stress and incoherence

**The implication: Tuning our musical and healing systems to Pythagorean ratios supports health.**

### Frequency as Medicine

Different traditions identify different healing frequencies:

**Solfeggio Frequencies:**
- **396 Hz**: Liberating guilt and fear
- **417 Hz**: Facilitating change and support
- **432 Hz**: Mathematical resonance (Pythagorean tuning)
- **528 Hz**: DNA repair (claimed, research ongoing)
- **639 Hz**: Connecting relationships
- **741 Hz**: Expression/solutions
- **852 Hz**: Returning to spiritual order

**Specific frequencies have specific effects:**
- **174 Hz**: Relieves pain and stress
- **285 Hz**: Repairs tissues and organs
- **396 Hz**: Releases negative emotions
- **417 Hz**: Removes negative energy
- **528 Hz**: Transformation and miracles
- **639 Hz**: Harmonizes relationships
- **741 Hz**: Detoxifies cells and organs
- **852 Hz**: Awakens intuition

**The general principle: Frequency matters for health.**

### Sound Healing: Vibrations That Restore

Sound healing uses **specific frequencies and intervals** to support the body's natural healing processes.

**Mechanisms:**
1. **Entrainment**: Your body rhythms synchronize with external rhythms
2. **Resonance**: Specific frequencies resonate with specific tissues
3. **Coherence**: Harmonious sound creates coherent bio-fields
4. **Vibration**: Sound physically vibrates tissues, affecting structure

**Documented effects:**
- Reduces stress and cortisol levels
- Lowers blood pressure and heart rate
- Reduces pain perception
- Improves sleep quality
- Accelerates tissue healing
- Balances brain waves

### Light Therapy: Photons as Information Carriers

Just as sound frequency affects the body, **light frequency and color** have healing effects.

**Light therapy uses specific wavelengths:**
- **Red light** (630-700 nm): Wound healing, skin health, inflammation
- **Near-infrared** (700-1000 nm): Tissue repair, pain relief, cellular energy
- **Blue light** (400-500 nm): Mood regulation, circadian rhythm
- **Green light** (500-570 nm): Pain relief, relaxation

**How light therapy works:**
1. **Cellular energy**: Light stimulates mitochondria to produce ATP
2. **Collagen production**: Red and NIR stimulate collagen synthesis
3. **Blood flow**: Light induces vasodilation, improving circulation
4. **Gene expression**: Light affects which genes are expressed
5. **Inflammation reduction**: Modulates inflammatory processes

### Water Memory: The Responsive Medium

Water is remarkable—it can carry information, structure itself in response to consciousness, and transform in response to frequency.

**Dr. Masaru Emoto's research demonstrated:**
- Positive words/intentions create beautiful, symmetric crystals
- Negative words/intentions create distorted, asymmetric crystals
- Music affects water crystal structure (harmonious music creates harmony)
- Prayer/Blessing water creates enhanced structure

While controversial, Emoto's work points to something important: **Water is responsive to consciousness and frequency.**

**Water structuring methods:**
- Intentions (prayer, blessing, positive thoughts)
- Frequency exposure (specific sounds/frequencies)
- Vortexing (swirling water in torus patterns)
- Crystal charging (placing crystals in/near water)
- Magnetic fields (exposing water to magnetic fields)

### The Bio-Field: Your Energy Body

The **bio-field** is the electromagnetic field that surrounds and permeates your body—a real, measurable aspect of your being that profoundly affects health.

**Characteristics:**
- Extends beyond the physical body
- Toroidal shape (like all coherent energy systems)
- Contains information about physical, emotional, mental state
- Interacts with other bio-fields and environmental fields
- Can be measured using sensitive instruments

**Healthy bio-field:**
- Coherent and balanced
- Extends evenly around body
- Smooth energy flow
- Appropriate strength

**Unhealthy bio-field:**
- Incoherent or imbalanced
- Uneven or distorted
- Blocked or stagnant areas
- Too weak or too strong

**HeartMath Institute research demonstrates:**
- The heart's electromagnetic field is 60x stronger than the brain's
- This field can be measured several feet from the body
- The field changes based on emotional state
- Coherent heart rhythms create coherent bio-fields
- Your field affects others (non-local effects)

**Heart coherence practice:**
1. Focus attention on heart area
2. Imagine breathing through heart
3. Inhale for 5 counts, exhale for 5 counts
4. Feel gratitude or appreciation
5. Continue for 3 minutes

**Benefits:**
- Reduces cortisol
- Balances nervous system
- Improves heart rate variability
- Enhances mental clarity
- Strengthens bio-field

### Practical Applications

**Morning routine (5-10 minutes):**
1. Hydrate with structured water
2. Sunlight exposure for circadian rhythm
3. Movement to activate bio-field (stretching, qigong)
4. Positive intention setting for the day

**Evening routine (5-10 minutes):**
1. Gratitude practice (shifts bio-field)
2. Release day's stress (meditation, journaling)
3. Harmonious music or silence
4. Sleep hygiene (dark, cool room)

**Sound healing for yourself:**
- Humming (creates coherent vibrations)
- Toning (vocalizing specific sounds)
- Chanting (sacred sounds: OM, AMEN)
- Listening (healing frequency recordings)

**Working with your bio-field:**
- Grounding (connect with earth, walk barefoot)
- Centering (align your energy)
- Shielding (protect from environmental influences)
- Clearing (release stagnant or negative energy)

2. Drink a glass of water (bless it with positive intention)
3. Spend 5 minutes in sunlight or natural light
4. Do 3 minutes of heart coherence breathing
5. Set a positive intention for your day

**Throughout the Day:**
1. Notice the patterns around you (spirals, torus shapes, Fibonacci)
2. When stressed, pause and breathe (restore coherence)
3. Listen to harmonious music when possible
4. Eat foods with vibrant colors (light as information)

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

### The Recognition

You've now been introduced to **The Universal Pattern**—the coherent design that structures reality from the smallest scale to the largest.

You've seen that:

- **Mathematics** reveals the pattern (Vortex Based Mathematics)
- **Geometry** displays the pattern (Sacred Geometry)
- **Physics** demonstrates the pattern (Unified Field Theory)
- **Music** expresses the pattern (Harmonic Theory)
- **Healing** applies the pattern (Energy Medicine)

This isn't five different things. **It's one thing, seen from different angles.**

### The Invitation

Here's the invitation:

**Don't just read this. Recognize the pattern in your own life.**

- Look for it in nature
- Listen for it in music
- Feel it in your body
- Use it in your decisions
- Create with it consciously

**The pattern is everywhere. Once you see it, you can't unsee it.**

And that's when the real journey begins.
