## 🚀 Vision

CE-Hub transforms the creation of intelligent agents through **Context Engineering** - a methodology that is **10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding**. Built on the foundational principle that **"Context is the Product,"** CE-Hub creates a systematic, self-improving ecosystem where every operation contributes to exponentially growing intelligence.

## 🏗️ Architecture

CE-Hub implements a sophisticated **four-layer architecture** designed for scalable, high-quality agent creation:

### **Layer 1: Archon (Knowledge Graph + MCP Gateway)**
- Authoritative knowledge repository with vector-based semantic search
- Real-time MCP interface for project/task coordination
- RAG system replacing memory-based approaches
- Systematic knowledge accumulation through closed learning loops

### **Layer 2: CE-Hub (Local Development + Documentation)**
- Active development workspace with living documentation
- Complete PRP (Plan → Research → Produce → Ingest) workflow repository
- Vision Artifact-aligned canonical documentation
- Chat knowledge system for context continuity

### **Layer 3: Sub-agents (Digital Team Specialists)**
- **Researcher**: Intelligence gathering and knowledge synthesis
- **Engineer**: Technical implementation and system development
- **Tester**: Quality assurance and validation
- **Documenter**: Knowledge capture and artifact preparation

### **Layer 4: Claude Code IDE (Execution + Supervision)**
- Secure execution environment with Plan-Mode precedence
- Human oversight and approval workflows
- Integration with all CE-Hub systems and protocols

## 📋 Core Principles

### **1. Context is the Product**
Every artifact designed for future reuse and intelligence enhancement, creating an exponentially growing ecosystem of reusable knowledge.

### **2. Archon-First Protocol**
All operations begin with Archon knowledge graph synchronization, ensuring systematic intelligence accumulation and RAG-driven decision making.

### **3. Plan-Mode Precedence**
Comprehensive planning always precedes execution, preventing costly iterations and ensuring alignment with requirements.

### **4. Self-Improving Development**
Closed learning loops enable continuous enhancement through systematic artifact ingestion and pattern recognition.

### **5. Digital Team Coordination**
Specialized sub-agent optimization for maximum workflow efficiency with seamless handoff protocols.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with standard library
- [Archon MCP Server](https://github.com/yourusername/archon) running on `localhost:8051`
- Claude Code IDE for optimal integration

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ce-hub.git
cd ce-hub
```

### Configuration
1. **Archon Integration**: Ensure Archon MCP is running at `localhost:8051`
2. **Claude Code Setup**: Open repository in Claude Code for full integration
3. **Chat System**: Initialize with `/new-chat "Getting Started" --project ce-hub`

## 💬 Chat Knowledge System

CE-Hub includes a lightweight chat knowledge system for seamless context continuity across Claude Code sessions:

### Core Commands
- **`/new-chat "<topic>" [--project <name>]`** - Create structured conversation files
- **`/load-chat "<topic|recent>" [--tail N]`** - Load conversations with context integration
- **`/summarize-chat "<topic>"`** - Generate Archon-ready summaries
- **`/weekly-ingest`** - Ingest summaries into Archon knowledge graph
- **`/monthly-prune`** - Archive old conversations with safety checks

### Workflow Integration
1. **End session**: `/summarize-chat "Your Topic" --project ce-hub`
2. **Weekly sync**: `/weekly-ingest --project ce-hub`
3. **New session**: `/load-chat "Your Topic" --project ce-hub`
4. **Continue seamlessly**: Full context restored from Archon or local files
