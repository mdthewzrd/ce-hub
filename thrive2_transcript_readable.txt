[00:00:08] a major turning point in my life

[00:00:11] was when i stopped being afraid of dying

[00:00:16] i used to think that i was my body

[00:00:19] but if i look deeper my body is made up

[00:00:22] of trillions of cells

[00:00:25] and if i keep looking deeper it's made

[00:00:28] up of trillions of atoms

[00:00:31] and what are the atoms made up of

[00:00:34] nothing they're just whirlpools in a sea

[00:00:39] of energy

[00:00:40] and those aren't things at all

[00:00:44] science tells me virtually every cell in

[00:00:46] my body has been replaced

[00:00:49] but foster's been here all along

[00:00:52] so my essential nature by definition

[00:00:56] by logic must be metaphysical

[00:01:02] so if i'm metaphysical who says that i

[00:01:05] die

[00:01:06] when my physical body tires out and goes

[00:01:10] away

[00:01:17] that's not only an intellectual

[00:01:19] understanding for me it was an

[00:01:21] experience that i'm actually an antenna

[00:01:24] in a field of energy tapping guidance

[00:01:27] from it

[00:01:28] and then bringing that into this body

[00:01:30] and into this physical world

[00:01:32] to fulfill my purpose

[00:01:36] this is where science and spirit

[00:01:39] physics and metaphysics all came

[00:01:42] together

[00:01:42] and fueled my journey of exploring the

[00:01:45] innovations

[00:01:46] and the technologies that reflect this

[00:01:52] understanding this

[00:01:54] blending of science and metaphysics has

[00:01:57] been a key topic in our lives for years

[00:02:00] it's based on an understanding of energy

[00:02:03] how it moves and interacts in the cosmos

[00:02:07] believe this interactive web of

[00:02:10] organized energy

[00:02:12] is exactly what albert einstein was

[00:02:14] seeking but never found

[00:02:16] the unified field

[00:02:22] [Music]

[00:02:23] a universal fabric of energy that

[00:02:26] connects

[00:02:26] all life

[00:02:33] the scientific story we've lived with

[00:02:35] for the past

[00:02:36] 300 years based largely on the theories

[00:02:39] of isaac newton

[00:02:40] has changed radically newton's universe

[00:02:44] operated like a machine with discrete

[00:02:47] matter

[00:02:48] moving through a vast emptiness of space

[00:02:50] and time

[00:02:51] with a separate human brain observing it

[00:02:56] [Music]

[00:02:57] looking at our cosmos as a connected

[00:02:59] field

[00:03:00] requires that we reconsider all that

[00:03:02] we've perceived is separate

[00:03:04] which is essentially everything

[00:03:09] as we come to understand this web of

[00:03:11] energy and how to relate to it

[00:03:13] harmoniously

[00:03:15] we will finally have a way for all life

[00:03:19] on planet earth

[00:03:21] not just to survive but to thrive

[00:03:32] kimberly carter gamble and i'm foster

[00:03:34] gamble

[00:03:36] in 2011 kimberly and i launched a film

[00:03:39] called thrive

[00:03:40] what on earth will it take the film has

[00:03:43] been translated into 27 languages

[00:03:46] and is now one of the most widely viewed

[00:03:48] documentaries in history

[00:03:49] we connected the dots among seemingly

[00:03:51] disparate subjects

[00:03:53] from an ancient cosmic code to

[00:03:55] cutting-edge physics

[00:03:56] from rigged banking and political

[00:03:58] schemes to the suppression of new energy

[00:04:01] holistic healing and ufo phenomena

[00:04:05] we unpacked what's in the way of

[00:04:07] humanity thriving

[00:04:09] and solution strategies for correcting

[00:04:11] the dangerous mess we're in

[00:04:14] the patterns we highlighted are even

[00:04:16] more relevant in the wake of the global

[00:04:18] response to covet 19.

[00:04:21] after the movie came out we heard from

[00:04:24] over a

[00:04:24] thousand innovators from all over the

[00:04:26] world scientists

[00:04:28] inventors medical doctors and

[00:04:31] researchers

[00:04:32] who told us about their technologies

[00:04:34] inventions

[00:04:35] and insights they claimed they had

[00:04:38] technologies that could do

[00:04:40] everything from cure cancer to access

[00:04:43] free energy

[00:04:44] clean abundant electricity source

[00:04:46] straight from space

[00:04:48] we knew they wouldn't all be legitimate

[00:04:51] but we also knew that if just a few were

[00:04:53] what they claimed

[00:04:54] it could completely transform our world

[00:04:58] so we put together teams of engineers

[00:05:00] and

[00:05:01] doctors and other experts to travel with

[00:05:03] us to

[00:05:04] africa china thailand

[00:05:08] egypt all through europe costa rica

[00:05:11] mexico and all over the united states to

[00:05:14] find out what they had

[00:05:16] our attention shifted from possibilities

[00:05:19] to results

[00:05:20] we weren't looking to make a sequel to

[00:05:22] thrive but the breakthroughs

[00:05:24] we saw were so profound that we knew we

[00:05:27] had to get this information out for

[00:05:28] others to see

[00:05:30] with a gorgeous abundant planet

[00:05:33] fundamentally good people and advanced

[00:05:36] technology

[00:05:38] why are we in such a lethal predicament

[00:05:41] is there something

[00:05:43] that we're not aware of yet the knowing

[00:05:45] of which would actually

[00:05:46] transform the quality of life on earth

[00:05:49] and have us thriving

[00:05:52] let's find out

[00:06:07] [Music]

[00:06:15] [Music]

[00:06:18] there's a huge change that happens in

[00:06:21] the civilization when they

[00:06:22] finally understand that there's a

[00:06:24] fundamental field that they're baiting

[00:06:26] in

[00:06:27] and that they can access it

[00:06:30] this unified field can begin to explain

[00:06:33] where does the energy of a magnet come

[00:06:35] from where does the energy of a

[00:06:36] nuclei of an atom that's spinning at

[00:06:38] near the speed of light in perpetuity

[00:06:41] where does that energy come from i

[00:06:43] believe that we're very very close to a

[00:06:45] true unified theory that is backed by

[00:06:48] consistent relatable mathematics

[00:06:52] and we've been trying very hard for a

[00:06:54] long time to define

[00:06:55] matter by studying matter the

[00:06:57] characteristics of matter the electron

[00:06:58] count the proton count the neutron

[00:07:00] all those things kind of come together

[00:07:03] but what if the answer the simple answer

[00:07:05] is by understanding fully the vacuum

[00:07:17] [Music]

[00:07:28] i've been studying the unified field and

[00:07:31] the phenomenon of accessing energy from

[00:07:33] it

[00:07:33] for more than 30 years and since 1997

[00:07:37] i've collaborated with cosmologist and

[00:07:39] inventor nasim

[00:07:40] harami he's probably more aware of the

[00:07:44] physics of how the universe works

[00:07:46] than anyone i've ever met even though he

[00:07:48] was not traditionally schooled

[00:07:52] i've seen him ridiculed and shunned by

[00:07:54] the traditional academic world

[00:07:56] but i've just never seen him proven

[00:07:58] wrong

[00:08:01] the space between you and i and the

[00:08:03] space between everything appears to be

[00:08:05] empty we call it

[00:08:06] empty space commonly but it's not

[00:08:10] space time at the very specific

[00:08:13] scale of the planck length is quantized

[00:08:16] with spherical

[00:08:17] units of planck oscillators billions of

[00:08:20] times

[00:08:21] smaller than the atom

[00:08:24] you can think of it as like a fluid that

[00:08:27] permeates

[00:08:28] all space

[00:08:32] it's a source of the gravitational field

[00:08:34] it's a source of the electromagnetic

[00:08:36] field it's a source of mass

[00:08:38] it's the source of charge

[00:08:41] so now we're starting to really

[00:08:42] understand the mechanics of it at the

[00:08:44] deeper level

[00:08:47] what is possible is extracting

[00:08:50] energy from the ubiquium it's all

[00:08:54] here it's right here that energy is here

[00:08:56] we're not violating any second law

[00:08:58] of thermodynamics we believe that the

[00:09:01] the background energy

[00:09:02] of everything around us is full of power

[00:09:04] and in a very very small area there's

[00:09:06] enough power to power our society

[00:09:08] for thousands of years

[00:09:11] i believe that the new level of

[00:09:14] physics the new level of technology

[00:09:17] that's emerging in the world

[00:09:19] that's extracting energy from the

[00:09:22] fundamental field

[00:09:23] are technologies that are finding a way

[00:09:27] to create a resonance link

[00:09:30] to this fundamental field

[00:09:35] i call the primary technology that i am

[00:09:38] developing

[00:09:39] to achieve gravity control the resonator

[00:09:43] [Music]

[00:09:44] it is an instrument that's attempting

[00:09:47] to achieve high level of resonance

[00:09:50] coupling

[00:09:51] to the fundamental quantum field that's

[00:09:54] at the source of reality

[00:09:58] though the device is not finished yet i

[00:10:00] think that they're working with the most

[00:10:02] advanced concept for accessing free

[00:10:04] energy from the unified field

[00:10:06] that i've ever seen or heard of

[00:10:12] this device is built out of two coils

[00:10:15] that produces

[00:10:16] a magnetic field in the geometry of a

[00:10:19] double taurus

[00:10:20] shape and then it spins

[00:10:23] that field in coordinated rotation

[00:10:27] to create this singularity that

[00:10:30] hopefully couples to the vacuum and

[00:10:32] that's what we believe

[00:10:33] it does to space-time

[00:10:38] inside the coil is a crystal container

[00:10:40] which is spherical

[00:10:42] that has plasma in it and the plasma

[00:10:45] is forced to rotate with the

[00:10:48] electromagnetic field structure

[00:10:50] as we power up the coil so

[00:10:53] we're basically making a little star

[00:10:56] inside

[00:10:57] a crystal ball the idea

[00:11:00] is that eventually we can start the

[00:11:04] field

[00:11:04] geometry in the plasma inside the

[00:11:07] crystal ball

[00:11:08] and get it rotating and when it's

[00:11:11] self-sustaining

[00:11:12] open the coil remove that that becomes

[00:11:15] a self-sustaining device that can be

[00:11:17] running

[00:11:18] a spaceship or your car or your house

[00:11:22] while making you healthy

[00:11:25] [Music]

[00:11:27] basically mimic what the universe does

[00:11:30] when it builds a star

[00:11:32] or when it builds a galaxy

[00:11:42] the next step for humanity the next step

[00:11:45] in our evolution

[00:11:46] i really believe is to understand

[00:11:48] gravity at the deeper level

[00:11:50] and learn to control it so that we can

[00:11:52] birth our civilization into a space

[00:11:55] civilization into a space colony we can

[00:11:58] explore solar system

[00:11:59] we can explore galaxy and maybe even

[00:12:01] beyond

[00:12:03] to me resonance represents the new world

[00:12:07] that is emerging

[00:12:10] given how centralized energy can be used

[00:12:13] to manipulate and control people

[00:12:15] and the dangerous and dirty ways

[00:12:17] corporations are extracting energy

[00:12:20] we've been highly motivated to find

[00:12:22] alternatives

[00:12:24] all the promising technologies we heard

[00:12:26] about were based on a

[00:12:28] common understanding that not only is

[00:12:31] everything

[00:12:31] energy but that energy is always

[00:12:35] moving that movement is called vibration

[00:12:39] and frequency is the rate at which it's

[00:12:42] vibrating

[00:12:48] when frequencies match in intensity we

[00:12:51] get what's called

[00:12:52] resonance

[00:12:55] we experience it as harmony it sounds

[00:12:58] good

[00:12:58] and it feels good

[00:13:07] according to quantum physics the field

[00:13:10] is geometric in design

[00:13:12] and woven into predictable patterns

[00:13:17] it unifies what are traditionally

[00:13:19] considered separate forces

[00:13:21] and the organizing principles apply at

[00:13:24] every scale

[00:13:25] [Music]

[00:13:28] the inventors we met were all operating

[00:13:31] on the understanding

[00:13:32] that the vacuum is not empty

[00:13:36] and that stillness is not still

[00:13:40] it's a dynamic of absolute

[00:13:44] balanced energy

[00:13:52] when we bring together all the new

[00:13:54] discoveries and we take into

[00:13:55] consideration what they're telling us

[00:13:58] it strongly suggests the existence of a

[00:14:00] geometric

[00:14:02] pattern so when we see energy

[00:14:05] moving through this field the energy is

[00:14:07] not moving haphazardly

[00:14:09] it is following preferred pathways

[00:14:12] defined by the geometry of

[00:14:16] the field itself

[00:14:20] geometry is not just points lines and

[00:14:23] planes like i learned in school

[00:14:25] it's about the push pull relationship of

[00:14:29] energetic systems

[00:14:30] like the pole between the earth and the

[00:14:32] sun gravity

[00:14:35] and the push out from the sun radiation

[00:14:39] pushing and pulling are essentially

[00:14:42] geometric phenomena

[00:14:44] and lines and planes are just our

[00:14:46] conceptual representations

[00:14:48] of those dynamics it's the

[00:14:51] predictability of this

[00:14:53] push and pull dynamic that allows the

[00:14:56] inventors to create

[00:14:57] replicable technologies the geometry is

[00:15:01] all based on energy moving and the shape

[00:15:04] of that movement

[00:15:06] is the taurus all of the projects

[00:15:10] reporting the best results were toroidal

[00:15:13] in design this is because the torus

[00:15:17] is the basic pattern that energy takes

[00:15:20] throughout the

[00:15:21] entire cosmos the taurus

[00:15:25] looks like a donut the energy flows

[00:15:28] in through one end circulates around the

[00:15:31] center

[00:15:32] and exits out the other end like a

[00:15:36] whirlpool in a stream

[00:15:38] it's made from the medium in which it

[00:15:40] exists

[00:15:41] and is at the same time discrete within

[00:15:44] it

[00:15:44] it's both distinct and unified

[00:15:48] and demonstrates why something could

[00:15:50] appear separate from something else

[00:15:52] and from the field while still being

[00:15:55] connected to it

[00:15:57] it's self-sustaining at every scale

[00:16:02] picture the eye of a hurricane at the

[00:16:05] center of

[00:16:05] every taurus has a point of stillness

[00:16:09] the field is basically a sea of tauruses

[00:16:13] each one touching its 12 identical

[00:16:16] neighbors

[00:16:16] like a stack of oranges

[00:16:18] [Music]

[00:16:20] connecting the center or still point of

[00:16:23] each

[00:16:24] taurus with its nearest neighbors

[00:16:27] reveals equal non-physical lines of

[00:16:30] force

[00:16:31] or vectors it's what

[00:16:34] visionary inventor and futurist

[00:16:37] buckminster fuller

[00:16:38] called the vector equilibrium

[00:16:51] [Music]

[00:16:53] when this balanced state of equilibrium

[00:16:56] is extended

[00:16:57] without boundaries it reveals that

[00:17:01] infinite fabric of space-time that

[00:17:03] fuller called the

[00:17:05] ivm or the isotropic vector matrix

[00:17:09] it just means the same in all directions

[00:17:12] this is the web of life force that the

[00:17:15] inventors say

[00:17:17] is the source of the energy that they're

[00:17:19] tapping

[00:17:21] life as we know it arises through

[00:17:24] contraction and expansion

[00:17:28] pulling and pushing it finds stability

[00:17:32] in

[00:17:32] symmetries six-fold

[00:17:35] [Music]

[00:17:39] five-fold

[00:17:41] [Music]

[00:17:44] four-fold

[00:17:47] [Music]

[00:17:48] threefold this pulsation of energy

[00:17:53] is what bucky fuller called the

[00:17:55] jitterbug

[00:17:56] the dance of the cosmos fuller humbly

[00:18:00] noted on his poster

[00:18:01] that this dynamic may come to be

[00:18:04] identified

[00:18:06] as the unified field

[00:18:10] so what is the unified field unifying

[00:18:14] this is what einstein was seeking until

[00:18:16] the day he died

[00:18:18] he was looking for the unifying insight

[00:18:21] that

[00:18:21] reconciles the four supposedly separate

[00:18:24] forces in the universe

[00:18:26] electromagnetism the strong and weak

[00:18:29] nuclear forces

[00:18:32] and gravity according to emerging

[00:18:36] unified field theory

[00:18:38] the dynamic of the taurus provides this

[00:18:41] reconciliation

[00:18:46] electricity and magnetism used to be

[00:18:48] seen as separate forces

[00:18:50] and we now know they're part of one

[00:18:52] dynamic called

[00:18:53] electromagnetism understanding this

[00:18:56] unification

[00:18:57] was what enabled michael faraday to

[00:19:00] invent the electric motor

[00:19:02] [Music]

[00:19:04] what if gravity and the strong and weak

[00:19:06] forces are not

[00:19:07] separate but are also part of the

[00:19:10] toroidal dynamic

[00:19:12] what new technologies can emerge from

[00:19:14] that understanding

[00:19:17] nasim haramine has postulated that

[00:19:19] gravity and the strong and weak nuclear

[00:19:21] forces

[00:19:22] are dynamics of how energy moves in the

[00:19:25] toroidal flow

[00:19:26] in this light gravity is a function of a

[00:19:29] whole

[00:19:29] field of infinitesimal spinning toruses

[00:19:33] being drawn towards larger

[00:19:35] concentrations of toruses

[00:19:37] that make up larger masses as the moon

[00:19:40] is pulled to the earth

[00:19:41] and the earth is drawn to the sun

[00:19:43] [Music]

[00:19:50] power means suggest protons are really

[00:19:53] mini black holes

[00:19:54] whose spin creates attraction between

[00:19:57] them

[00:19:58] despite the repulsion we would expect

[00:20:00] from their positive charge

[00:20:03] this attraction is what is referred to

[00:20:05] as the strong force

[00:20:07] from this perspective what's referred to

[00:20:09] as the weak force

[00:20:10] is the result of the natural

[00:20:12] fluctuations

[00:20:13] of the nucleus emanating waves into the

[00:20:17] [Music]

[00:20:18] field

[00:20:22] [Music]

[00:20:24] unifying the four forces reminds me of

[00:20:26] the fabled blind men

[00:20:28] holding on to different parts of the

[00:20:30] elephant and describing it as a rope

[00:20:32] or a tree or a snake

[00:20:36] the elephant in this case is the

[00:20:38] toroidal energy dynamic

[00:20:40] of the unified field

[00:20:43] [Music]

[00:20:46] using the smallest measure a single wave

[00:20:49] of light he calls the planck's spherical

[00:20:51] unit

[00:20:52] and postulating that its form is

[00:20:54] toroidal

[00:20:56] paramean predicted that this dynamic is

[00:20:58] operating at

[00:20:59] every scale by applying this hypothesis

[00:21:03] he was able to determine the mass of all

[00:21:05] the elements

[00:21:06] and predicted the radius of protons and

[00:21:09] electrons

[00:21:10] while also showing this understanding of

[00:21:13] the spin of the unified field

[00:21:16] as the source of mass gravity

[00:21:20] charge and many physical constants

[00:21:24] all this with unprecedented accuracy

[00:21:29] why does the proton matter the proton is

[00:21:32] matter

[00:21:34] everything we see in our reality is what

[00:21:36] we call matter

[00:21:37] if we understand the proton then most

[00:21:40] likely that understanding

[00:21:41] will be correct at larger scale and

[00:21:43] that's what we're finding

[00:21:47] so it really tells us about our reality

[00:21:51] and how it got here

[00:21:52] and how it works harami developed a new

[00:21:56] scaling law showing the toroidal shape

[00:21:59] of systems

[00:22:00] throughout the universe his work

[00:22:02] correlates with the notion of a grand

[00:22:04] nested hierarchy there is one pattern at

[00:22:08] all

[00:22:08] scales from planck's spherical units

[00:22:15] within protons

[00:22:18] within atoms

[00:22:22] to molecules

[00:22:28] within cells

[00:22:32] [Music]

[00:22:34] organisms

[00:22:39] within planets

[00:22:47] solar systems within galaxies

[00:22:58] within a vast field of galactic clusters

[00:23:03] [Music]

[00:23:06] when italian astronomers were searching

[00:23:08] to see if there was a predictable

[00:23:10] pattern

[00:23:10] to how galaxies cluster they found what

[00:23:13] they call the egg carton universe

[00:23:19] this pattern is identical to what we are

[00:23:22] discovering

[00:23:23] at all scales as the fabric

[00:23:27] of space-time

[00:23:39] [Music]

[00:23:41] the way to access this source field of

[00:23:43] energy

[00:23:44] appears to be through stillness

[00:23:47] sometimes called the zero point

[00:23:50] stillness is not static

[00:23:54] it's a state of harmonic resonance

[00:23:58] a rhythmic balanced interchange of

[00:24:01] energy

[00:24:03] with energy frequencies the state

[00:24:06] of complete balance functions like a

[00:24:09] straw

[00:24:11] it intersects with the stillness at the

[00:24:15] center of

[00:24:15] each taurus in the field tapping

[00:24:19] into its pure potential

[00:24:23] stillness is a portal

[00:24:26] for accessing boundless electricity

[00:24:31] developing healing technologies

[00:24:34] expanding consciousness

[00:24:38] or simply finding peace of mind

[00:24:43] energy moving creates sound

[00:24:46] only some of which is in our human range

[00:24:49] of hearing

[00:24:51] the unified field theory proposes that

[00:24:54] sound waves

[00:24:55] at different frequencies are what shape

[00:24:59] energy from the field into

[00:25:02] matter

[00:25:05] we can see this phenomenon unfold in

[00:25:08] nature

[00:25:09] when sound waves interact with any form

[00:25:11] of matter

[00:25:12] for example fluid or sand

[00:25:16] acoustic pressure reliably creates

[00:25:19] specific

[00:25:20] predictable patterns

[00:25:28] [Music]

[00:25:43] [Applause]

[00:25:44] [Music]

[00:25:57] in fact music seems to be the master key

[00:26:01] to understanding the unified field

[00:26:05] life is an acoustic reality a sea of

[00:26:09] sound waves

[00:26:10] and what we call music is how it's

[00:26:12] organized

[00:26:14] music is not something that people

[00:26:16] created it's something that we

[00:26:18] discovered

[00:26:19] to work with because it already existed

[00:26:22] in the universe

[00:26:24] every planet has a unique audio

[00:26:36] signature

[00:26:38] [Music]

[00:26:41] there's a beautiful recording of the

[00:26:44] sound of the magnetic field of our earth

[00:26:47] being strummed like the strings of a

[00:26:49] guitar

[00:26:50] by the solar wind that is coming from

[00:26:53] our sun

[00:26:55] and when nasa took the satellite

[00:26:58] recordings and they bumped it into the

[00:27:00] audible range it became possible for us

[00:27:02] to actually hear the song

[00:27:04] of earth's magnetic fields

[00:27:09] [Music]

[00:27:15] energy waves at all scales follow the

[00:27:19] same harmonic principles as music

[00:27:21] octaves intervals

[00:27:25] and tuning

[00:27:26] [Music]

[00:27:28] tuning is when two or more frequencies

[00:27:31] come into harmonic resonance

[00:27:33] tuning guitar uses the same principles

[00:27:36] as the inventors are using to create

[00:27:38] health

[00:27:38] and energy technologies they all spoke

[00:27:41] of tuning their devices

[00:27:43] to achieve a state of perfect balance

[00:27:47] tuning ourselves to resonate with how

[00:27:49] the universe works

[00:27:51] gives us a way to come into harmony with

[00:27:53] one another

[00:27:55] and with our planetary home

[00:28:10] music literally is the universal

[00:28:13] language

[00:28:14] universe one song

[00:28:31] [Music]

[00:28:42] um

[00:29:02] the insight that the cosmos unfolds with

[00:29:05] predictable order

[00:29:07] provides a revolutionary context for

[00:29:10] reality itself

[00:29:12] elegant mathematical harmonious

[00:29:16] like a symphony

[00:29:30] [Music]

[00:30:14] [Music]

[00:30:24] there's a saying that someone with good

[00:30:26] health wants many things

[00:30:28] and someone who's sick wants just one

[00:30:32] being healthy is not just a personal

[00:30:35] prerequisite

[00:30:36] has became painfully clear with the

[00:30:38] pandemic induced collapse of 2020

[00:30:42] it's the fulcrum for the economy of

[00:30:44] communities

[00:30:46] countries the whole world

[00:30:49] along with energy inventors we were

[00:30:51] contacted by doctors and healers who

[00:30:54] reported phenomenal results using

[00:30:56] energy in the form of sound and light

[00:30:58] waves

[00:30:59] to promote healing according to quantum

[00:31:03] physics

[00:31:04] sound waves are what shape matter

[00:31:07] our bodies are matter so it makes sense

[00:31:10] that sound frequencies

[00:31:12] could also impact us i

[00:31:15] traveled the world investigating how

[00:31:17] these new insights

[00:31:19] into vibration frequency and resonance

[00:31:23] are transforming our understanding of

[00:31:25] biology

[00:31:27] and health

[00:31:34] [Music]

[00:31:54] health to me is clear communication

[00:31:58] between an individual and the unified

[00:32:01] field

[00:32:02] we have billions of chemical reactions

[00:32:04] happening

[00:32:05] in each of our trillions of cells every

[00:32:08] second

[00:32:09] and they're happening in a coordinated

[00:32:11] manner sometimes faster than the speed

[00:32:13] of light

[00:32:14] what's responsible for that

[00:32:16] communication and coordination

[00:32:18] and connection the field humanity has

[00:32:21] been given an idea that there are two

[00:32:23] realms to the universe a physical

[00:32:25] mechanical realm the material things

[00:32:26] that we see

[00:32:27] as well as an invisible realm in a

[00:32:30] newtonian world

[00:32:31] only physical things can affect a

[00:32:32] physical body and that led to the

[00:32:35] development and evolution of the

[00:32:36] pharmaceutical industry which sells

[00:32:38] chemicals to affect our body

[00:32:42] and then we find out from quantum

[00:32:43] physics that energy

[00:32:45] signals are profoundly more effective

[00:32:48] in controlling biology than matter

[00:32:51] chemistry by its definition

[00:32:53] is always associated with side effects

[00:32:55] they're not side effects

[00:32:56] they're direct effects three hundred

[00:32:58] thousand people die every year in

[00:33:00] america from taking prescription drugs

[00:33:02] if you're sitting around a table with

[00:33:05] three women

[00:33:07] one of you is taking an antidepressant

[00:33:09] we have

[00:33:10] half of americans today opening up to

[00:33:13] four prescription bottles

[00:33:14] every day but when you learn more

[00:33:18] about what the evidence actually

[00:33:20] suggests around

[00:33:22] how well these medications really work

[00:33:24] and

[00:33:25] how potentially harmful they can be

[00:33:28] you might begin to think ah there could

[00:33:32] be a better way

[00:33:34] if instead of suppressing symptoms our

[00:33:37] goal is healing

[00:33:38] what would be different all of the

[00:33:41] health innovators who i met

[00:33:43] related to the body with respect and to

[00:33:46] symptoms

[00:33:46] with curiosity it's feedback what's our

[00:33:50] body telling us is out of order

[00:33:52] so to these healers just suppressing a

[00:33:55] symptom

[00:33:55] is actually cutting off a much needed

[00:33:58] source of information

[00:33:59] because they look to get it the cause of

[00:34:02] a problem

[00:34:03] rather than just stop the effects of

[00:34:05] there being a problem

[00:34:06] i certainly don't mean to imply that

[00:34:08] your allopathic doctor doesn't want you

[00:34:10] to get well

[00:34:11] or that there's no use for conventional

[00:34:13] medicine it's good for all kinds of

[00:34:16] things

[00:34:16] it's that the doctors don't even have

[00:34:19] access to the full range of options

[00:34:21] early diagnosis and self-help natural

[00:34:24] and energy-based cures don't benefit the

[00:34:28] pharmaceuticals

[00:34:29] and pharmaceutical companies are the

[00:34:31] ones funding the medical education and

[00:34:34] influencing regulatory approvals and

[00:34:36] laws

[00:34:37] what conventional doctors are taught and

[00:34:40] have access to

[00:34:41] is all funneled through the same

[00:34:44] centralized

[00:34:44] control matrix our life expectancy has

[00:34:48] fallen over the last few years

[00:34:51] for the first time in history and now if

[00:34:54] you look at the life expectancy

[00:34:56] in the united states compared to other

[00:34:58] countries we're

[00:34:59] 30th we have the highest incidence of

[00:35:03] depression obesity

[00:35:06] yet we're spending more per capita

[00:35:09] on health care than any other nation in

[00:35:12] the world

[00:35:16] the new science is based on energy

[00:35:19] energy

[00:35:19] medicine you can heal with energy much

[00:35:22] more effectively than you can heal with

[00:35:24] chemistry

[00:35:25] i was able to see hundreds of people

[00:35:28] treated with the whole

[00:35:30] range of energy-based technologies

[00:35:32] including

[00:35:33] one that uses a cord of frequencies

[00:35:36] to create a still point which appears to

[00:35:40] elicit powerful healing effects

[00:35:43] it was developed by dr todd oveikitis

[00:35:48] at the level of physics we know that

[00:35:52] the cells are always vibrating in a

[00:35:54] sense they're always singing a type of

[00:35:56] song

[00:35:57] that song is the sum of all the

[00:35:59] vibrations of all the molecules

[00:36:01] in that particular tissue so we had

[00:36:05] found a vibrational pattern that was

[00:36:08] somehow

[00:36:09] in resonance with the stem cell-like

[00:36:13] cells

[00:36:14] that cause them to intensely go where

[00:36:16] the beam had been

[00:36:18] the theory is that each kind of cell has

[00:36:21] a distinct

[00:36:22] energetic signature that can be matched

[00:36:25] and this technology appears to have

[00:36:28] found a way to do

[00:36:29] just that i asked

[00:36:32] dr beth mcdougall to demonstrate what

[00:36:34] she thought was happening with this

[00:36:36] photo acoustic device

[00:36:41] in order to really talk about how this

[00:36:43] instrument is affecting changes in the

[00:36:45] body i'd like to talk

[00:36:46] a little bit about v cells v cells

[00:36:49] or v s e ls stand for very small

[00:36:54] embryonic-like cells these are

[00:36:57] dormant stem cells that have been

[00:36:59] present in your body since the time you

[00:37:01] were forming as an embryo

[00:37:03] this photo acoustic technology seems to

[00:37:06] hold the key to unlock the dormant dna

[00:37:10] in these cells

[00:37:13] well i was diagnosed with parkinson's

[00:37:16] three years ago

[00:37:17] and my experience of it up to then had

[00:37:20] been seeing my father suffer from it in

[00:37:22] the 70s and 80s

[00:37:23] it was really the end of his productive

[00:37:25] life and i was devastated to

[00:37:27] feel that that might be my fate as well

[00:37:32] the results have been really

[00:37:34] life-changing

[00:37:35] i got my body back and i got my mind

[00:37:38] back

[00:37:40] my father had parkinson's for 27 years

[00:37:43] and watching what he went through was

[00:37:45] one of the hardest things in my life

[00:37:47] to see this guy's face and

[00:37:51] imagining what it would have been like

[00:37:52] for my father to be able to restore his

[00:37:54] body

[00:37:55] and his mind now i just feel really

[00:37:59] grateful knowing the millions of people

[00:38:01] whose lives will go forward in ways that

[00:38:03] my father wasn't able to experience

[00:38:06] [Music]

[00:38:07] the earlier that we can detect and

[00:38:10] decode

[00:38:10] symptoms of an illness the easier it is

[00:38:13] to remedy the underlying cause

[00:38:16] historically acupuncturists listen to a

[00:38:19] patient's voice to help with diagnosis

[00:38:22] two inventors i met are now running the

[00:38:25] voice

[00:38:25] through complex machine learning

[00:38:27] algorithms

[00:38:28] to detect imbalance in specific organs

[00:38:32] they then identify the vibrational

[00:38:35] signatures of the deficient minerals or

[00:38:38] vitamins

[00:38:39] and feed those vibrations back into the

[00:38:42] body

[00:38:43] as sound waves through a headset

[00:38:48] [Music]

[00:38:51] all of the nervous impulses in the body

[00:38:54] are

[00:38:54] coming together through the vagus nerve

[00:38:57] and are being emitted by the voice which

[00:38:59] is like

[00:39:00] the speaker where the nerves are like

[00:39:03] the speaker wire all of that information

[00:39:06] creates

[00:39:07] vibrational imprints within the vocal

[00:39:09] cords when you're speaking we have

[00:39:11] greater and greater understanding

[00:39:12] because we are able to detect

[00:39:15] conditions of disharmony prior to

[00:39:18] a physical condition manifesting in the

[00:39:20] body

[00:39:21] we can empower people to start taking

[00:39:23] care of themselves

[00:39:25] while they're still healthy so that they

[00:39:27] never have to get sick

[00:39:28] when you go to your doctor there's not

[00:39:30] often that they ask you if you're in

[00:39:31] tune

[00:39:32] they listen to you where the stethoscope

[00:39:33] makes your heart's beating they listen

[00:39:35] for your lungs but they're not seeing if

[00:39:36] your heart and your lungs are all

[00:39:37] running in the same

[00:39:38] resonance our technology is really there

[00:39:40] to provide

[00:39:41] a way to do that to look at the body in

[00:39:43] this holistic way

[00:39:44] and see where you're out of harmony and

[00:39:46] where you're out of tune

[00:39:47] and provide a way to actually bring the

[00:39:49] body back into resonant harmony

[00:39:56] in my travels i came across a team who

[00:39:59] reported

[00:40:00] fabulous results remedying all kinds of

[00:40:03] diseases

[00:40:04] by alkalizing the cellular environment

[00:40:07] i had heard from a friend about a place

[00:40:09] his mom had gone where she healed from

[00:40:12] stage four metastasized cancer

[00:40:14] he said she's not the only one and when

[00:40:17] i got there

[00:40:18] i saw the evidence

[00:40:22] hey hi hi the largest organ of the human

[00:40:26] body

[00:40:27] is called the interstitium and it

[00:40:29] contains 60

[00:40:30] of our body fluids and this is what

[00:40:33] needs to be measured both in its ph

[00:40:36] and its chemistry in order to determine

[00:40:39] the actual health of the human body

[00:40:42] so why doctors use only

[00:40:46] information from the blood for the

[00:40:48] diagnosis

[00:40:49] and completely ignore interstitial fluid

[00:40:54] dr galena magalco and robert young use a

[00:40:57] combination of

[00:40:58] live blood cell thermogram sonogram

[00:41:02] and other modalities one device dr

[00:41:05] mcgalco uses

[00:41:06] is the bioelectric scan which measures

[00:41:10] the electrical charge

[00:41:11] of cell fluid when we do interstitial

[00:41:15] fluid scans

[00:41:16] which is the electrical potential of

[00:41:20] your cells will look at it like your

[00:41:22] battery on your phone

[00:41:24] the vitality of the charge reveals a lot

[00:41:27] about the cell's capacity to communicate

[00:41:30] salt is an electrical conductor and

[00:41:33] cells

[00:41:33] communicate through electrical impulses

[00:41:37] according to dr miguel cohen young

[00:41:40] disease

[00:41:41] including cancer arises when the fluid

[00:41:44] in the interstitium

[00:41:46] loses its alkalinity its salt and

[00:41:48] minerals

[00:41:49] and becomes too acidic for the cells to

[00:41:52] communicate effectively

[00:41:54] to stay in balance cancer

[00:41:57] is not a disease of the cells

[00:42:00] but it's a condition of the cells as an

[00:42:04] expression

[00:42:05] of what's happening in the internal

[00:42:06] fluids of the body so cancer can be

[00:42:09] explained

[00:42:10] as a condition so i like to use it as an

[00:42:12] adjective

[00:42:14] cancer is a cancerous condition of the

[00:42:17] cell

[00:42:18] this team's treatment is simple

[00:42:21] affordable

[00:42:22] and it has spectacular results people

[00:42:25] came to young

[00:42:26] center from all over the world based on

[00:42:28] word of mouth

[00:42:29] out of more than 320 people

[00:42:33] using this protocol 96

[00:42:37] successfully resolved stages one

[00:42:40] two and three cancers and 81 percent

[00:42:44] successfully reversed their stage 4

[00:42:47] cancer

[00:42:51] i was diagnosed in february of 2012 with

[00:42:55] stage 3 breast cancer

[00:42:57] i came to the ranch and within two weeks

[00:42:59] i'd lost 15 pounds and my tumor that was

[00:43:01] at 3.18 reduced in size to 1.1

[00:43:04] after nine weeks my tumor was completely

[00:43:06] gone it took me about

[00:43:08] three months to reverse the colon cancer

[00:43:11] and the esophageal cancer

[00:43:14] [Music]

[00:43:18] seeing these amazing results i wondered

[00:43:21] what dr young would see with my blood

[00:43:23] i ate well and exercised for most of my

[00:43:26] life

[00:43:27] but i had been feeling really tired for

[00:43:29] a few weeks

[00:43:30] and i was noticing i often felt dizzy

[00:43:32] when i stood up

[00:43:33] it's always just a simple little that's

[00:43:35] it

[00:43:39] there it is you're showing irregular

[00:43:42] patterns in this part of the body

[00:43:45] they're irregularly shaped

[00:43:47] like this which is a cancer profile

[00:43:50] okay okay that doesn't mean you have

[00:43:53] cancer but we see it

[00:43:54] years in advance okay so that's what

[00:43:57] makes this test so powerful

[00:43:59] because we see something that's

[00:44:00] happening prior to the actual

[00:44:03] you know realization like say it shows

[00:44:05] up on a mri or a cat scan

[00:44:08] i was shocked to see how unhealthy my

[00:44:10] blood looked

[00:44:12] i realized i had never even considered

[00:44:14] the

[00:44:15] salt mineral balance in my body i

[00:44:18] started taking the salt

[00:44:19] and within a few months my blood was

[00:44:21] significantly improved

[00:44:24] i'm happy to say my little red blood

[00:44:26] cells are no longer deformed or clumped

[00:44:29] my energy's back and i still do a

[00:44:32] very strict alkaline diet and drink the

[00:44:35] salt and minerals every day

[00:44:37] so there's a real challenge here the

[00:44:39] notion of somebody else prescribing a

[00:44:41] magic pill

[00:44:42] so that i can just keep barreling ahead

[00:44:45] can be tempting

[00:44:47] but there are no magic pills i

[00:44:50] can still be super healthy and feel

[00:44:52] great

[00:44:53] i just need to watch what i eat i have

[00:44:56] to exercise

[00:44:57] i need to pay attention to what i'm

[00:44:59] thinking and catch any imbalance early

[00:45:01] and deal with it

[00:45:03] it's like whoa this great healthy vital

[00:45:06] life

[00:45:07] actually requires something of me

[00:45:11] it's the same with peace of mind we

[00:45:14] actually have to

[00:45:15] do something to find clarity and

[00:45:18] maintain

[00:45:19] inner balance so how do the dynamics of

[00:45:22] the unified field

[00:45:23] help us with that

[00:45:38] [Music]

[00:45:43] [Music]

[00:45:54] consciousness is information

[00:45:58] consciousness is a living breathing

[00:46:00] compendium

[00:46:01] or library of information that is

[00:46:04] informing the entire field around us

[00:46:10] not just here in front of us locally but

[00:46:13] distally as well

[00:46:14] that that consciousness has an

[00:46:16] organization it has a pattern to it

[00:46:23] so throughout history in the field has

[00:46:25] been called many names such as

[00:46:27] the web spirit it's been called the

[00:46:30] source

[00:46:31] the one the divine matrix it's been

[00:46:34] called consciousness

[00:46:36] god these are shared in poetic terms

[00:46:39] thousands of years ago but they're

[00:46:41] actually very accurately

[00:46:43] describing what the best science of the

[00:46:44] modern world is now

[00:46:46] discovering we are in constant

[00:46:49] communication

[00:46:50] with this field there's a dialogue that

[00:46:52] we may or may not recognize we are

[00:46:54] speaking to the field and the field is

[00:46:56] responding

[00:46:57] to us every moment of every day of our

[00:46:59] lives

[00:47:03] on my trips through central america i

[00:47:06] encountered

[00:47:06] scientists healers and shamans

[00:47:10] who described interacting with the

[00:47:12] unified field

[00:47:13] to heal the mind and transform

[00:47:16] consciousness

[00:47:19] [Music]

[00:47:22] for them vibration frequency

[00:47:26] and resonance are tools for freeing us

[00:47:30] from our limiting beliefs

[00:47:32] and expanding our sense of what's

[00:47:34] possible

[00:47:36] with their guidance i experienced

[00:47:39] viscerally that the field was not

[00:47:42] something

[00:47:43] outside of me but a living force

[00:47:46] within me consciousness actually evolves

[00:47:50] according to the same

[00:47:52] predictable principles and patterns

[00:47:55] that characterize the field

[00:47:59] one of foster's mentors arthur young

[00:48:02] not only invented the bell helicopter he

[00:48:05] also discovered a road map

[00:48:07] for how consciousness evolves throughout

[00:48:10] nature

[00:48:12] arthur young's theory of process covers

[00:48:15] the entire sweep of evolution

[00:48:18] in seven stages

[00:48:21] in his book the reflexive universe the

[00:48:23] evolution of consciousness

[00:48:25] he outlines how evolution is a process

[00:48:28] put in motion by purpose

[00:48:31] a primal spark of consciousness from a

[00:48:34] field of pure potential

[00:48:36] begins to acquire new powers

[00:48:39] from the push and pull dynamics of the

[00:48:41] subatomic realm

[00:48:43] to the acquiring of identity as atoms

[00:48:47] that then combine into molecules

[00:48:51] each formation meeting the challenge to

[00:48:53] take the next step

[00:48:56] it was when the molecule mastered

[00:48:58] temperature a way to balance its inner

[00:49:01] and outer environments as cells that

[00:49:04] life as we know it was born a game

[00:49:07] changer

[00:49:09] when cells mastered growth plants were

[00:49:13] born

[00:49:14] then life mastering mobility

[00:49:17] created animals and then

[00:49:21] meeting the challenge of self-awareness

[00:49:23] became

[00:49:24] human became us

[00:49:28] at each stage a new challenge and a new

[00:49:31] capacity

[00:49:33] our human challenge like that of the

[00:49:35] molecule

[00:49:36] is to balance our inner and outer worlds

[00:49:39] to come into harmony with ourselves with

[00:49:42] each other

[00:49:44] and with our environment i believe that

[00:49:47] when we pass this test

[00:49:49] what awaits us is a new freedom and

[00:49:52] creativity

[00:49:53] the likes of which we can hardly imagine

[00:49:56] purpose is what drives the whole story

[00:49:59] this is why knowing our purpose

[00:50:01] and aligning it with the dynamics of the

[00:50:03] field is so important

[00:50:06] it can help us transcend the human

[00:50:08] conflicts that have taken us to the

[00:50:10] brink of self-destruction

[00:50:13] over the years we've found powerful

[00:50:15] tools for evolving human consciousness

[00:50:18] one of the most direct ways to tune

[00:50:19] ourselves to the field

[00:50:21] is with brainwave biofeedback

[00:50:24] [Music]

[00:50:25] for many years i worked with dr james

[00:50:27] hart and his biocybernaut technology

[00:50:31] we did neural feedback research and

[00:50:33] training

[00:50:34] teaching people how to reduce stress and

[00:50:37] to increase

[00:50:38] focus healing and intuition by getting

[00:50:41] real-time feedback on the frequencies of

[00:50:43] the brain

[00:50:45] the brainwaves of most mammals including

[00:50:48] humans

[00:50:48] resonate at a particular frequency when

[00:50:51] at rest

[00:50:52] but still alert we're riding on a wave

[00:50:56] that scientists call the schumann

[00:50:57] resonance a frequency field surrounding

[00:51:00] the planet

[00:51:01] vibrating at around eight cycles per

[00:51:03] second

[00:51:05] it's sometimes called the heartbeat of

[00:51:06] the earth

[00:51:08] it's like a still point a portal between

[00:51:11] our inner

[00:51:11] and our outer worlds

[00:51:15] time and again we observed yogis zen and

[00:51:18] qigong masters and proven psychics

[00:51:20] as they passed through that portal

[00:51:23] remained awake and aware

[00:51:25] and changed their states of

[00:51:27] consciousness the way most of us would

[00:51:28] switch

[00:51:29] channels on our tv dr hart's research

[00:51:33] shows that anyone can cultivate this

[00:51:34] ability

[00:51:35] to move between various brainwave states

[00:51:38] at will

[00:51:40] it's a matter of practice

[00:51:45] the notion that we're in a constant

[00:51:47] dialogue with the field

[00:51:49] helps explain how virtually all the

[00:51:51] scientists doctors

[00:51:53] philosophers and shamans we met

[00:51:56] described getting profound

[00:51:58] insights what they call downloads

[00:52:01] in dreams meditation

[00:52:04] near-death experiences or times of

[00:52:06] extreme focus

[00:52:09] others throughout history attribute

[00:52:11] information coming through in this way

[00:52:13] for such far-reaching inspirations as

[00:52:16] elias howe's invention of the sewing

[00:52:18] machine german chemist friedrich

[00:52:20] kekule's discovery of the structure of

[00:52:22] the benzene molecule

[00:52:24] walter russell's prediction of

[00:52:26] previously unknown atomic elements

[00:52:29] and paul mccartney's song yesterday

[00:52:33] virtually everyone i've asked reports

[00:52:36] similar experiences in their own life

[00:52:43] for centuries people have used

[00:52:46] meditation

[00:52:47] and prayer to access deeper awareness

[00:52:51] and connection to the divine

[00:52:54] [Music]

[00:52:59] the silence and stillness required for

[00:53:02] achieving these states

[00:53:04] mirrors the process of accessing the

[00:53:06] field through the still point

[00:53:09] just as with energy and health

[00:53:11] technologies

[00:53:12] personal stillness works like a straw

[00:53:16] to draw on the unified field and bring

[00:53:18] its

[00:53:19] infinite possibilities into our lives

[00:53:24] someone who's profoundly helped me to

[00:53:27] become more adept at finding my own

[00:53:29] stillness

[00:53:30] is my dear friend and teacher mitra

[00:53:33] politi

[00:53:34] [Music]

[00:53:36] meditation and prayer in the essence of

[00:53:39] it they are

[00:53:40] leading to the same place it's a

[00:53:42] connection with source

[00:53:45] then there is a equilibrium there is a

[00:53:49] meeting point

[00:53:50] between the divinity of the field

[00:53:53] to the divinity of oneself

[00:53:57] within meditation for me there is few

[00:54:00] major benefits

[00:54:03] one is to reflect where i'm at with my

[00:54:06] actions and with my thoughts and with my

[00:54:08] feelings

[00:54:09] second to bring a more soft dialogue

[00:54:11] between me and myself

[00:54:14] and eventually to connect back to the

[00:54:16] creator to connect back to

[00:54:18] all that there is through that process

[00:54:21] there is a

[00:54:22] thin zero point

[00:54:24] [Music]

[00:54:25] is the sound of silence that puts

[00:54:28] everything

[00:54:29] back into the place you know

[00:54:32] that is a great practice to to bring to

[00:54:35] anything

[00:54:36] this is a great practice to to have as

[00:54:38] an ally

[00:54:39] it's a great practice to keep us

[00:54:41] evolving in the right direction

[00:54:47] there's a lot of evidence that the field

[00:54:49] is responsive to the power of attention

[00:54:52] as well as to the power of intention

[00:54:56] two guides i met along my travels were

[00:54:58] regan hillier

[00:55:00] and juan pablo barrahona who take a

[00:55:02] whole systems approach to helping people

[00:55:05] manifest

[00:55:06] what they want in their lives

[00:55:08] [Music]

[00:55:11] in the activation work that we do it all

[00:55:14] starts from within

[00:55:20] the more we expand our field and the

[00:55:23] more permeable we are

[00:55:25] to being resonance in vibration with the

[00:55:28] field that is around

[00:55:29] us the more we can flow in synchronicity

[00:55:34] it is a process of seven stages related

[00:55:37] to

[00:55:38] the physical body the mind the emotions

[00:55:41] the energy that flows to our nervous

[00:55:43] system and

[00:55:44] through our energy centers and how that

[00:55:47] relates to the

[00:55:48] magnetic field that we emanate

[00:55:52] [Music]

[00:55:54] we don't always get in life what we

[00:55:56] dream about but we do get what we

[00:55:59] tolerate

[00:56:00] you see if everyone got what they dream

[00:56:02] about then everyone's dreams would

[00:56:03] instantly be here right now

[00:56:05] but we do receive our minimum standard

[00:56:08] that's a guarantee

[00:56:09] so when i'm working with people i'm

[00:56:11] always asking them what's your dream

[00:56:13] what's your vision and we're connecting

[00:56:14] with that

[00:56:15] but then we're looking at what is your

[00:56:17] current reality

[00:56:18] because your current reality is a direct

[00:56:21] reflection of

[00:56:22] everything that you're tolerating right

[00:56:25] now

[00:56:28] when we look around the world at our

[00:56:29] current reality

[00:56:31] what are we tolerating why getting in

[00:56:44] touch with what's possible

[00:56:46] and tuning ourselves to a greater

[00:56:48] resonance have beckoned humanity

[00:56:50] throughout the ages

[00:56:52] one method used all over the world is

[00:56:54] breath meditation

[00:56:56] with each breath we literally draw the

[00:56:59] life force of the field

[00:57:01] into our bodies

[00:57:07] so many of us have no idea how we're

[00:57:10] breathing at all

[00:57:11] and the number one way that we can

[00:57:13] control our experience

[00:57:14] is to pay attention to our breath

[00:57:18] fear sadness

[00:57:21] stress all these things that cause

[00:57:24] illness or even just like physical pain

[00:57:26] all of that those are like low

[00:57:28] frequency energies that we carry in our

[00:57:30] field

[00:57:31] so just by using your breath by bringing

[00:57:33] in more oxygen you kind of create this

[00:57:35] high

[00:57:36] frequency circuit that literally can

[00:57:38] change your electromagnetic field

[00:57:43] when i was in central america checking

[00:57:45] out health technologies

[00:57:47] i visited an extraordinary healing

[00:57:50] center called rhythmia

[00:57:51] where i was introduced to plant medicine

[00:57:56] for thousands of years indigenous people

[00:57:59] have used various plant medicines

[00:58:01] including ayahuasca when ingested in a

[00:58:05] sacred ceremony

[00:58:07] these natural substances can create an

[00:58:10] altered state of consciousness

[00:58:12] that's conducive to physical emotional

[00:58:15] and spiritual breakthroughs

[00:58:22] [Music]

[00:58:28] one thing that separates us from lots of

[00:58:31] other

[00:58:32] retreat centers and plant medicine

[00:58:34] facilities and

[00:58:35] resorts is that we have a medical

[00:58:38] license

[00:58:38] the benefit is that it puts people at

[00:58:41] great ease

[00:58:42] and the whole goal of plant medicine

[00:58:46] is to let people relax enough to hear

[00:58:49] their soul

[00:58:52] when i listened to the shamans at

[00:58:54] rhythmia describe what they were doing

[00:58:56] i remember later telling foster it was

[00:58:59] like i was listening to the energy

[00:59:01] inventors

[00:59:02] they were using exactly the same terms

[00:59:06] vibration frequency and resonance

[00:59:09] it was wild

[00:59:14] when systems

[00:59:47] as my teacher explains we humans we're

[00:59:49] based on sound

[00:59:50] we're energy so when we do healing

[00:59:53] there's a block in the frequency

[00:59:56] something's not matching up

[00:59:58] and when we apply the song or the prayer

[01:00:00] there's the counter frequency

[01:00:02] there to bring balance or resonance

[01:00:04] within that person's energetic field

[01:00:12] during the journey with the plant

[01:00:14] medicine the reorganizing is happening

[01:00:17] first

[01:00:18] so it can come in shape in color it can

[01:00:21] come as

[01:00:22] understanding it can come as a death and

[01:00:25] reaper

[01:00:26] process can come as a vision and

[01:00:30] insight and there is always a subtle

[01:00:34] dialogue between

[01:00:37] challenge and awakening

[01:00:47] [Music]

[01:00:56] [Music]

[01:01:04] [Music]

[01:01:15] [Music]

[01:01:44] [Music]

[01:02:02] thank you

[01:02:14] [Music]

[01:02:18] to

[01:02:23] [Music]

[01:02:32] look

[01:02:40] [Music]

[01:02:46] uh

[01:02:51] my experience with ayahuasca transformed

[01:02:54] my relationship with my mother

[01:02:56] with my children and most of all

[01:03:00] the medicine showed me that none of us

[01:03:03] is

[01:03:03] ever alone that expanded consciousness

[01:03:07] is always available waiting

[01:03:10] to be our most exquisite

[01:03:13] loving dance partner i realized that

[01:03:17] science spirituality and ancient wisdom

[01:03:21] all converge in the unified field

[01:03:34] [Music]

[01:03:48] the same ingenuity and radical thinking

[01:03:51] that we experienced in the realms of

[01:03:53] health

[01:03:54] and consciousness we also encountered in

[01:03:56] the world of energy

[01:03:58] the inventors who claimed they had

[01:04:00] engineered devices that could provide

[01:04:01] limitless clean energy describe their

[01:04:05] work with the same terms as the healers

[01:04:07] and shamans

[01:04:08] vibration frequency resonance

[01:04:12] all characteristics of interacting with

[01:04:14] the unified field

[01:04:21] by looking at mathematics and music

[01:04:24] and art and science physics as all part

[01:04:28] of one continuum of awareness and

[01:04:30] understanding

[01:04:31] we can tackle the big problems

[01:04:49] [Music]

[01:04:52] understanding the musical and

[01:04:54] mathematical nature of the cosmos

[01:04:56] opens up a whole new way of thinking

[01:05:00] a great example of this is an unlikely

[01:05:02] inventor that we found deep in the

[01:05:04] jungles of costa rica

[01:05:06] hart acherson

[01:05:09] the way i learned to think was with

[01:05:12] music

[01:05:13] so when you're thinking in musical terms

[01:05:16] you're thinking in another structure and

[01:05:18] that structure

[01:05:20] could open up other doors that are not

[01:05:23] accessible

[01:05:26] through verbal or word-based

[01:05:34] communication

[01:05:39] [Music]

[01:05:42] the core issue of our whole civilization

[01:05:45] the core

[01:05:46] reason for non-sustainability comes from

[01:05:50] centralization they have centralized

[01:05:53] education centralized

[01:05:55] control of language centralized

[01:05:57] dictionaries centralized government

[01:05:59] centralized religion

[01:06:00] and centralized energy

[01:06:12] you turn on a light switch in your house

[01:06:15] you click the switch the light comes on

[01:06:17] what really happened what really

[01:06:19] happened is maybe a hundred miles away

[01:06:22] there's a large generator producing

[01:06:26] enough electricity for hundreds of

[01:06:28] thousands of houses

[01:06:30] it comes out of that generator and gets

[01:06:33] transmitted with

[01:06:34] wires at probably

[01:06:37] a hundred thousand volts then it goes

[01:06:40] into your house through your breaker box

[01:06:42] through the meter that the

[01:06:44] grid company has there and goes through

[01:06:48] your switch which has just completed the

[01:06:50] circuit so that it can go through your

[01:06:51] light bulb and make the light

[01:06:53] come on that requires an enormous amount

[01:06:57] of

[01:06:57] maintenance and capital expense to do

[01:06:59] that so now we're contrasting it to a

[01:07:02] house

[01:07:03] that has a transverse solar system that

[01:07:05] means in the utility room there's some

[01:07:07] electronic boxes with transverse stuff

[01:07:10] in them and there's some batteries

[01:07:11] and the roof there's some solar panels

[01:07:13] and

[01:07:14] you also have a connection to the grid

[01:07:16] so when you throw that switch it

[01:07:18] completes the circuit but it comes

[01:07:20] right from the transverter but it

[01:07:23] immediately has

[01:07:24] access to the energy from its batteries

[01:07:27] the solar panels the grid

[01:07:31] and maybe your next door neighbor the

[01:07:33] grid's

[01:07:34] importance all of a sudden has has been

[01:07:36] demoted

[01:07:37] it's just one of many possible sources

[01:07:45] we discovered that there are three main

[01:07:47] categories in the field of energy

[01:07:49] that we need to solve as a species one

[01:07:51] of them is generation of energy

[01:07:53] how we get it another is transmission of

[01:07:56] energy

[01:07:57] how to get it from one place to another

[01:07:59] and the third one is

[01:08:00] integration of energy how to get it into

[01:08:02] the existing grid

[01:08:05] hearts work is the best example we've

[01:08:07] found in the area of integration

[01:08:10] his technology takes solar wind

[01:08:14] geothermal or these various so-called

[01:08:17] free energy technologies

[01:08:19] and adapts them to homes or to local

[01:08:21] grids

[01:08:22] with what he calls the heart transverter

[01:08:28] the reason i got the transverter system

[01:08:31] installed was because

[01:08:34] the power here fluctuates quite a bit

[01:08:36] and there's a lot of power outages as

[01:08:38] well

[01:08:39] and also having the energy security

[01:08:41] knowing that you know even when the

[01:08:43] power grid went out

[01:08:44] we always had our essential electricity

[01:08:46] was running

[01:08:47] now we run two houses with

[01:08:50] a number of refrigerators a pool pump

[01:08:53] fans

[01:08:54] even air conditioning but we have a

[01:08:58] power purchase agreement as well so any

[01:09:00] excess power we get credit for

[01:09:02] so our electricity bills now run at

[01:09:04] about 10 dollars a month

[01:09:06] it's just which is just the rental for

[01:09:08] the meter

[01:09:10] so there aren't really any bills

[01:09:17] it's a micro grid node so it's capable

[01:09:21] of sharing with its neighbors and its

[01:09:23] neighbors can cluster together in

[01:09:25] larger microgrids and share with other

[01:09:28] clusters

[01:09:29] so you're doing it from the bottom up

[01:09:33] your core thing

[01:09:35] is the individual home and it can work

[01:09:37] up to where you support an entire

[01:09:39] civilization

[01:09:45] it's kind of like a fractal

[01:09:48] you've got a group at the home you've

[01:09:51] got a bigger cluster of these

[01:09:56] and it could cover the whole city of

[01:09:58] boston it could cover

[01:10:00] the whole united states

[01:10:03] it could do our whole planet

[01:10:07] we can't move from where we are today to

[01:10:09] 100 renewable energy

[01:10:11] with the grid system that we have

[01:10:13] renewable energy fluctuates too much so

[01:10:15] it collapses and affects the grid in a

[01:10:17] negative way

[01:10:19] now heart has created something where we

[01:10:21] can actually

[01:10:22] transition from where we are today to

[01:10:24] 100 renewable energy

[01:10:27] without negatively affecting the power

[01:10:29] grid

[01:10:30] and just knowing that we're part of that

[01:10:33] movement

[01:10:34] has been quite profound for me we got to

[01:10:37] come up with solutions

[01:10:39] that we can implement like yesterday

[01:10:46] one of the principles of the field is

[01:10:48] that it's infinitely dispersed

[01:10:51] decentralization is aligned with that

[01:10:53] principle

[01:10:55] we heard about these two brothers james

[01:10:58] and kenneth coram

[01:10:59] who spent the last 20 years working on

[01:11:02] energy transmission

[01:11:04] their aim was to reconstruct the

[01:11:06] technology behind nikola tesla's

[01:11:08] wardencliffe tower

[01:11:10] which was built to transmit energy

[01:11:13] wirelessly

[01:11:15] that tower was destroyed by tesla's

[01:11:17] financier

[01:11:18] jp morgan who realized the wireless

[01:11:21] transmission

[01:11:22] would obsolete copper wiring and

[01:11:24] undermine the profits from his own

[01:11:26] copper mines

[01:11:29] tesla was using the work of a man named

[01:11:31] zenit who discovered a wave that travels

[01:11:34] almost instantaneously

[01:11:36] in the field around our planet it

[01:11:38] follows the surface of the earth

[01:11:41] and when it moves it doesn't have any

[01:11:43] harmful effects on human beings

[01:11:45] tesla was looking to ride the xenic wave

[01:11:48] to transmit both energy

[01:11:50] and communications

[01:11:53] the quorum brothers have apparently now

[01:11:55] recreated that technology

[01:11:57] with modern materials and achieved what

[01:12:00] tesla had set out to do

[01:12:02] you'll be able to put an antenna on your

[01:12:04] car that will just tap the field for

[01:12:06] electricity

[01:12:07] you'll be able to put one on your home

[01:12:09] or your local power station

[01:12:12] that energy can be tapped by an ocean

[01:12:14] liner crossing the sea

[01:12:15] with an antenna on top without burning

[01:12:18] any polluting fuels

[01:12:20] the zenith technology is the best one we

[01:12:22] found for transmitting energy

[01:12:24] in a low-cost and healthy way

[01:12:29] these innovations in energy integration

[01:12:32] and transmission are brilliant

[01:12:34] and make it possible to keep a lot of

[01:12:36] our existing infrastructure in place

[01:12:39] of course we also really need clean

[01:12:41] energy sources

[01:12:43] that are decentralized and affordable

[01:12:45] for them to transmit and integrate

[01:12:48] tapping into a field of infinite energy

[01:12:51] would do so much to improve the actual

[01:12:54] daily lives of all of us everywhere on

[01:12:57] this planet

[01:12:58] that's why we've spent so much of our

[01:13:01] time and resources

[01:13:02] investigating inventors who claimed

[01:13:04] breakthroughs in the generation of

[01:13:06] energy

[01:13:07] one promising energy source comes from

[01:13:10] hydrogen

[01:13:11] it's the most abundant element in the

[01:13:13] entire universe

[01:13:14] it's essentially everywhere the key to

[01:13:17] hydrogen is that when it's ignited it

[01:13:19] creates heat

[01:13:20] and the heat can be transferred into

[01:13:22] power

[01:13:24] so if we can do that efficiently and

[01:13:26] inexpensively

[01:13:27] then we can use it to run our cars or

[01:13:29] factories

[01:13:30] or an entire community it could

[01:13:32] substitute for dirty coal

[01:13:34] and repurpose the 15 000 plus coal

[01:13:37] plants

[01:13:38] that are wreaking havoc with the earth

[01:13:40] the miners and the people living nearby

[01:13:43] it could also replace nuclear and

[01:13:44] fracking

[01:13:46] but currently extracting hydrogen from

[01:13:48] water

[01:13:49] is too expensive to be a viable option

[01:13:52] in thailand however

[01:13:53] we found a guy who claimed his team had

[01:13:56] discovered a way to access hydrogen

[01:13:58] for fuel absolutely cleanly and for

[01:14:02] virtually nothing

[01:14:04] the inventor himself does not do media

[01:14:06] appearances but he authorized one of his

[01:14:09] technicians

[01:14:09] who built the device to give us a tour

[01:14:14] there's a gas in the water you can burn

[01:14:17] so you can

[01:14:18] make a fire out of water

[01:14:21] this inventor apparently has found a way

[01:14:24] to use earth minerals

[01:14:26] in a pressurized vortex to access

[01:14:29] pure hydrogen cheaply and efficiently we

[01:14:32] found an easy way to make hydrogen you

[01:14:34] don't need a big

[01:14:35] fancy electrolysis

[01:14:38] factory we find a system where the

[01:14:42] hydrogen it comes out from a

[01:14:45] kind of chemical reaction we have some

[01:14:47] special mix

[01:14:48] the device that they've created to

[01:14:50] extract hydrogen

[01:14:51] is as beautiful as any energy technology

[01:14:54] i've ever seen

[01:14:56] they found the secret of how to catalyze

[01:14:59] a reaction in this compound

[01:15:02] that then just gives off essentially

[01:15:04] free hydrogen

[01:15:06] we asked ourselves the question what

[01:15:08] does the world need

[01:15:10] we think hydrogen is the best way to

[01:15:11] solve this problem

[01:15:14] i was encouraged by the hydrogen device

[01:15:17] still under development

[01:15:18] and what also really excited me were the

[01:15:20] technologies for extracting energy

[01:15:22] directly from the field for over 20

[01:15:25] years i've searched the world for

[01:15:26] working free energy devices

[01:15:30] a really common objection to even the

[01:15:33] notion of a free energy device

[01:15:35] is that it can't be because physics has

[01:15:38] certain proven laws

[01:15:40] and this would be in violation of that

[01:15:43] so

[01:15:43] if in fact there is a device that is

[01:15:46] running without being plugged into

[01:15:48] anything

[01:15:48] for long periods of time such that it

[01:15:51] proves that it's accessing energy from

[01:15:53] somewhere else

[01:15:54] then either the law is wrong or the law

[01:15:57] is misunderstood

[01:15:58] and i think for the most part the law is

[01:16:02] misunderstood

[01:16:05] the first law of thermodynamics states

[01:16:08] that an isolated energy producing system

[01:16:11] can't generate more energy than goes

[01:16:13] into it

[01:16:15] this may be correct within closed

[01:16:17] systems

[01:16:18] but atoms sons

[01:16:21] galaxies and the cosmos itself

[01:16:25] like the magnet on your refrigerator are

[01:16:28] open

[01:16:28] systems

[01:16:33] the successful devices we are seeing are

[01:16:35] specifically designed as open

[01:16:38] not isolated systems so the limitations

[01:16:42] of the first law

[01:16:43] don't apply when it comes to accessing

[01:16:45] energy from one realm

[01:16:46] to another

[01:16:50] [Music]

[01:16:54] i learned about a young man in africa

[01:16:56] who claimed to have built a car

[01:16:58] a generator and even a helicopter that

[01:17:01] ran on radio frequencies

[01:17:03] a true free energy device that keeps

[01:17:05] batteries consistently charged

[01:17:07] it took me several months to find him

[01:17:09] but when i did

[01:17:10] it blew my mind i knew it would be

[01:17:14] complicated

[01:17:14] because these things always are

[01:17:18] going to zimbabwe the ethiopian airline

[01:17:21] that we had tickets with had just had a

[01:17:23] major crash

[01:17:25] and a cyclone had just ravaged the area

[01:17:28] leaving hundreds dead

[01:17:33] well we're sitting in a hotel in harare

[01:17:35] zimbabwe this morning

[01:17:37] we're here today to start the vetting

[01:17:39] process and find out okay what

[01:17:40] what's real over 95 percent of the time

[01:17:43] these things aren't what they

[01:17:44] claim to be this time we took engineer

[01:17:47] nils

[01:17:47] ragnaroo to assist with the vetting when

[01:17:50] nils and i arrived and met maxwell

[01:17:52] i was very impressed with just what a

[01:17:54] gentle true seeming soul he was

[01:17:56] and then the next morning we went to see

[01:17:58] the device and he gave us a full tour

[01:18:01] i was practically ecstatic it was such a

[01:18:04] beautiful

[01:18:05] elegant device what we're looking at

[01:18:08] is called the green power of grid

[01:18:11] machine

[01:18:12] it is half a megawatt and we are

[01:18:14] realigning with the radio frequency

[01:18:16] behind the radio frequency converted

[01:18:18] into pure energy that is useful

[01:18:21] it is called a microsonic energy device

[01:18:24] a microsonic energy device it is the

[01:18:26] generator

[01:18:28] in this machine for people who are not

[01:18:31] familiar with this

[01:18:32] half a megawatt how much will that power

[01:18:35] in terms of a house or a community or

[01:18:37] what

[01:18:37] we're talking of about 300 a standard

[01:18:40] house arms yeah okay that you can power

[01:18:43] with one machine

[01:18:44] so there's no oil burning there's no

[01:18:46] fires going on anything so

[01:18:48] where so where's the energy coming from

[01:18:50] we're highnessing it straight away from

[01:18:52] the

[01:18:53] the natural energy that god has just put

[01:18:56] in the air

[01:18:56] in in our on our earth yeah the radio

[01:18:59] frequency

[01:19:00] so nothing on yourself but the main

[01:19:02] point is that a meter away there's no

[01:19:04] frequencies being transmitted from a

[01:19:07] microwave tower

[01:19:09] next to the park we're standing in it's

[01:19:12] a poignant

[01:19:13] day for us here and amidst the

[01:19:16] excitement of seeing this for the first

[01:19:18] time

[01:19:19] a couple of strangers showed up on the

[01:19:21] site where we were being shown

[01:19:22] these devices and maxwell the inventor

[01:19:26] took us aside

[01:19:27] as soon as he could and said these guys

[01:19:29] are from the government and i didn't

[01:19:30] know they were coming

[01:19:32] unfortunately we're truly concerned

[01:19:34] about this

[01:19:35] gentleman and we're just going to take

[01:19:38] every precaution that we can to keep

[01:19:41] ourselves safe to keep him

[01:19:42] safe and to keep this knowledge safe

[01:19:46] the microphone we had on maxwell picked

[01:19:48] up the conversation

[01:19:49] that he had with one of the officials so

[01:19:52] he quickly got the tape translated

[01:19:54] and found out that the government

[01:19:56] official was promising maxwell

[01:19:58] a power purchase agreement where the

[01:20:00] government would pay him for generating

[01:20:02] energy for the country

[01:20:04] it was good corroboration that they

[01:20:06] believed he had what he claimed

[01:20:08] although maxwell didn't trust him

[01:20:10] because the government had already put

[01:20:12] him in prison in an effort to steal his

[01:20:14] technology

[01:20:16] in fact when maxwell was put in prison

[01:20:20] he was put in a cell with one of the

[01:20:22] richest guys in zimbabwe

[01:20:24] a man named genius that's his real name

[01:20:27] whom the government had

[01:20:28] jailed to extort more money from maxwell

[01:20:31] was in great despair

[01:20:33] and praying for like five or six hours

[01:20:35] at a time

[01:20:36] it was driving genius crazy and he was

[01:20:38] saying why are you praying so much

[01:20:40] shut up finally they ended up talking

[01:20:43] and genus was impressed and said okay

[01:20:47] i'll help you man it was the most

[01:20:49] unlikely

[01:20:51] couldn't have scripted it way for

[01:20:53] maxwell to be able to have somebody on

[01:20:55] his team with

[01:20:56] real business savvy and support and it

[01:20:58] was forged right there in prison

[01:21:01] i love that so when we ended when

[01:21:05] prison maxwell was praying every you

[01:21:08] know

[01:21:08] now and then so i'm asking why do you

[01:21:11] pray like that

[01:21:12] it's too much from the time i have known

[01:21:15] him

[01:21:17] i've learned a lot from him he sees

[01:21:20] people

[01:21:21] i think they were god disease people i

[01:21:23] think you saw it when you were driving

[01:21:24] people

[01:21:25] can just block his way not to attack him

[01:21:28] but

[01:21:29] everyone likes him if you just deal with

[01:21:31] the right people

[01:21:34] me and max will take this to another

[01:21:35] level we were feeling very excited about

[01:21:38] our progress with maxwell and hoped that

[01:21:40] we would soon be able to conduct a

[01:21:42] thorough vetting of the device

[01:21:44] however we started running into issues

[01:21:46] suspicions of our motives and intentions

[01:21:49] were starting to circulate amongst

[01:21:50] maxwell's advisors

[01:21:54] so maxwell sent this note saying hi

[01:21:57] foster we have talked and i'm advised

[01:21:59] that the further tests you requested

[01:22:01] won't be possible because of a number of

[01:22:03] issues such as

[01:22:06] one where it's intended to be used

[01:22:10] if on investors the single most

[01:22:14] important thing of all this to me

[01:22:15] is we do the duration test so we find

[01:22:18] out

[01:22:19] do we think that this technology is real

[01:22:21] as claimed

[01:22:22] or not

[01:22:28] [Music]

[01:22:30] call decline

[01:22:37] okay then

[01:22:40] so i'm trying to get in touch with

[01:22:42] maxwell because

[01:22:43] we're down to our last day once again in

[01:22:46] the next few hours we need to

[01:22:48] make a decision are we going to change

[01:22:51] reservations once again

[01:22:53] and stay over which is going to be a

[01:22:55] real hit on our budget

[01:22:56] but this is what it takes

[01:23:04] and is the ultimately consciously or

[01:23:06] subconsciously

[01:23:08] trying to to get it so that we either

[01:23:11] have to leave

[01:23:12] we just can't wait around any longer so

[01:23:14] we don't get the

[01:23:15] to the result we came for and we don't

[01:23:18] get to

[01:23:19] expose some potential problem with the

[01:23:21] thing

[01:23:26] [Music]

[01:23:27] i don't know i don't know either

[01:23:32] for me the low point of that whole trip

[01:23:34] to zimbabwe

[01:23:35] was when we had been waiting in the

[01:23:37] hotel room for a number of days

[01:23:39] and we were getting these texts with

[01:23:41] kind of false accusations and suspicions

[01:23:45] and then one came in and said when's

[01:23:47] your plane

[01:23:48] you should just go that was like the

[01:23:52] moment of

[01:23:53] okay he's not just stalling he's saying

[01:23:55] go away

[01:23:58] so that's when i really had to search

[01:23:59] deep inside myself for can i put up with

[01:24:02] this

[01:24:03] do i think he has the capability to

[01:24:05] actually come around

[01:24:07] but both of those things get resolved

[01:24:09] for me and

[01:24:11] i don't know if he's going to come

[01:24:12] around but i know that i'm

[01:24:14] true his suspicions are false

[01:24:17] so that if i can just hang in there and

[01:24:19] actually get into reality again with him

[01:24:22] at least we've got a shot and i pictured

[01:24:25] being on the plane

[01:24:26] going home with a complete failure and

[01:24:29] not

[01:24:30] knowing and the possibility that this

[01:24:32] was maybe the best energy device i've

[01:24:34] ever seen

[01:24:35] and we got kicked out based on

[01:24:36] misunderstandings

[01:24:39] that was so much more horrible to me

[01:24:41] than the obnoxious need to wait

[01:24:43] and the expenses that were being accrued

[01:24:44] in the process of it

[01:24:48] just when our hope was beginning to fade

[01:24:50] we received a text from maxwell

[01:24:52] he was ready for us to conduct a full

[01:24:54] vetting of the device

[01:24:56] we're not sure what had changed but we

[01:24:58] were excited and ready to go

[01:25:03] one final hurdle was finding some

[01:25:05] additional batteries the inventor needed

[01:25:07] for the test

[01:25:08] okay so we're trying to come up with

[01:25:10] enough money to

[01:25:11] buy the rest of the batteries that the

[01:25:14] inventor

[01:25:14] needs to do the test this afternoon

[01:25:17] before we're supposed to leave tomorrow

[01:25:18] max explained that the energy tapped

[01:25:20] from radio frequencies

[01:25:22] runs through batteries so the batteries

[01:25:24] don't lose their charge but you still

[01:25:26] need them for the process

[01:25:30] found another envelope in the safe this

[01:25:33] is

[01:25:33] a zimbabwe petty cash

[01:25:36] we have another ninety dollars folks

[01:25:44] [Music]

[01:25:48] the biggest boss

[01:25:51] biggest friend thank you so much for

[01:25:54] helping us out today this is this is the

[01:25:56] big day

[01:25:58] yeah what we're doing today will be so

[01:26:00] important for maxwell

[01:26:01] and for you with other people who are

[01:26:03] interested in the technology

[01:26:05] ultimately they need to know that it

[01:26:07] lasts

[01:26:08] long enough to prove what the device

[01:26:10] does and then also

[01:26:11] nils will be measuring the voltage of

[01:26:14] the batteries during the test and that

[01:26:16] will reveal whether it's

[01:26:17] what he has claimed or not

[01:26:22] so i'm sitting here in mr genius's

[01:26:24] office we've just taken the next step

[01:26:26] toward getting this bedding done

[01:26:28] because they didn't have the right

[01:26:30] batteries they didn't have enough

[01:26:31] batteries in the device to do the

[01:26:33] duration test that we need

[01:26:35] the inventor did not have enough cash to

[01:26:38] buy all the

[01:26:39] new batteries so we needed to get cash

[01:26:41] and you cannot get

[01:26:42] cash out of banks or currency shops or

[01:26:46] anything in zimbabwe right now so

[01:26:48] fortunately mr genius said come to my

[01:26:51] office

[01:26:52] and we can swipe a credit card and get

[01:26:54] you the cash

[01:26:55] take you over and get you the batteries

[01:26:57] so that transaction has taken place with

[01:27:00] a little extra drama

[01:27:02] we're home free to the next step anyway

[01:27:07] [Music]

[01:27:13] big blue started at 4 36 p.m

[01:27:17] we're here with maxwell and the test is

[01:27:21] starting

[01:27:22] once we arrived on site our goal for the

[01:27:25] vetting was to establish that the device

[01:27:27] could power a welding machine

[01:27:29] which uses a lot of electricity very

[01:27:31] quickly for long enough that it couldn't

[01:27:33] be running on batteries alone

[01:27:38] so you were asking where the energy came

[01:27:40] from you mentioned the other day the sun

[01:27:42] but it's not like solar energy no it's

[01:27:44] not we're not using solar energy because

[01:27:45] this one is not even affected with

[01:27:47] clouds light and things like that it

[01:27:50] does

[01:27:50] work so the the energy the the radio

[01:27:54] frequencies that you're

[01:27:55] harnessing are they there

[01:27:58] in space in the field all the time yes

[01:28:01] they are from the first day we started

[01:28:04] testing the machine we have been

[01:28:05] analyzing and we saw that there are the

[01:28:07] frequencies there

[01:28:08] but one thing that we want to know for

[01:28:09] sure is

[01:28:11] is it alien or is it go

[01:28:14] is it man made from another planet is it

[01:28:17] from god

[01:28:18] that's the way we need i think

[01:28:20] scientifically scientific people

[01:28:22] to define exactly but we know the rate

[01:28:24] of frequency we have everything

[01:28:28] if it's still a fully charged battery

[01:28:31] the test is successful it's not screws

[01:28:33] oh there's 217.9

[01:28:35] that's perfect

[01:28:41] so that's that's the 18 batteries yeah

[01:28:43] that's the 18 batches

[01:28:44] so that's higher than the nominal

[01:28:46] voltage

[01:28:48] dude wow

[01:28:51] that is awesome

[01:29:02] thank you thank you so much

[01:29:05] one final check of the battery voltage

[01:29:07] revealed a

[01:29:08] shocking result not only had the machine

[01:29:11] outlasted the expected battery life

[01:29:14] but the batteries were still fully

[01:29:16] charged

[01:29:18] this proved that the device was being

[01:29:20] powered from an

[01:29:21] unknown energy source thank you this is

[01:29:24] one of the happiest days of my life

[01:29:27] and i am so proud of this man who has

[01:29:30] gone through so much

[01:29:31] he's listened to the voice of the divine

[01:29:34] coming through him

[01:29:35] and he's done whatever it takes to bring

[01:29:38] this through for humanity

[01:29:39] so congratulations my friend thank you

[01:29:42] so much

[01:29:46] now we're gonna get you well

[01:29:52] i got your emojis we just finished just

[01:29:54] got back to the hotel

[01:29:56] after a completely successful wedding

[01:29:59] oh my god i really want to honor

[01:30:02] that this could not have happened

[01:30:05] without you

[01:30:06] every one of us would have left

[01:30:11] that situation i am just super super

[01:30:15] grateful for that and i'm super

[01:30:17] grateful that we have an opportunity for

[01:30:20] people to see it because

[01:30:21] it helps people so much to know what's

[01:30:24] possible

[01:30:25] the test we did yesterday is historic

[01:30:29] i still i'm digesting it because

[01:30:32] it basically means the end of fossil

[01:30:34] fuels

[01:30:40] [Music]

[01:30:42] i'd say the main thing that i have

[01:30:44] learned personally from this trip

[01:30:46] it's more a reinforcement of something

[01:30:49] that i

[01:30:50] i know but you know doubt now and then

[01:30:53] is that whatever the question

[01:30:56] the answer is always more love because

[01:31:00] our relationship with this inventor was

[01:31:02] on the rocks

[01:31:03] you know it was tempting to just say hey

[01:31:06] i came to help you if you don't want it

[01:31:07] we're out of here

[01:31:09] and i know from past experience that you

[01:31:12] know wait through that that's not a

[01:31:13] great emotional place to make a decision

[01:31:15] from

[01:31:16] and we just kept telling him the truth

[01:31:19] even when he didn't believe it

[01:31:20] and then loving him even when he

[01:31:21] couldn't allow it in and

[01:31:23] at the end being with us he could see

[01:31:27] that number one our motives were true

[01:31:29] and number two

[01:31:30] we were treating him with love

[01:31:34] we've spent the last eight years

[01:31:36] traveling the globe

[01:31:37] in search of insights and technologies

[01:31:40] that could

[01:31:41] radically transform our world and we

[01:31:44] found them so why don't we all have

[01:31:47] access to these promising breakthroughs

[01:31:59] [Music]

[01:32:06] [Music]

[01:32:10] we don't have access to these

[01:32:12] world-changing breakthroughs because

[01:32:14] we're not allowed to have them

[01:32:16] virtually every solution we found has

[01:32:18] been made illegal

[01:32:20] or suppressed often violently

[01:32:23] maxwell's been imprisoned and tortured

[01:32:26] to try to get his secrets

[01:32:28] and he and his first partner before

[01:32:30] genius

[01:32:31] were both poisoned maxwell's still

[01:32:34] recovering from it and his partner died

[01:32:38] one of the of the painful realities

[01:32:42] i have seen in the in energies this is a

[01:32:45] very dangerous

[01:32:47] game altogether yeah especially free

[01:32:50] energy

[01:32:50] because you know as they said if

[01:32:54] they can try to to to kill to kill it

[01:32:58] using professional people and that has

[01:33:00] happened to me

[01:33:01] i went through a lot poisons as i'm

[01:33:04] saying right now

[01:33:05] i'm fighting it they come to you then

[01:33:08] they said no you mustn't do this

[01:33:11] when they see that you know you're not

[01:33:13] giving up

[01:33:14] then they can just frame you then they

[01:33:16] can say no you've done abc

[01:33:18] my prayer is this thing must save the

[01:33:20] light of the day

[01:33:22] [Music]

[01:34:02] then

[01:34:07] innovators in any one sector often think

[01:34:10] that theirs is the only one being

[01:34:12] curtailed

[01:34:14] that's not our conclusion dr young whose

[01:34:18] non-pharmaceutical healing treatments

[01:34:20] were simple and effective

[01:34:22] has also been imprisoned this is the

[01:34:25] spot where i was arrested

[01:34:27] so i had 13 counts of fraud

[01:34:31] 12 counts of practicing medicine without

[01:34:33] a license

[01:34:34] and one count of conspiracy i was found

[01:34:37] guilty

[01:34:38] on two charges of practicing medicine

[01:34:41] without a license so out of those 320

[01:34:44] clients

[01:34:46] i was found guilty on practicing

[01:34:48] medicine the one

[01:34:50] was changing an iv and the other one was

[01:34:53] removing an iv bag

[01:34:55] so that's what i'm guilty of

[01:34:58] the sentence was the was the most

[01:35:00] extreme

[01:35:01] was it was 3.7 years

[01:35:04] on our way to see dr young we randomly

[01:35:06] stopped at a coffee shop where we met a

[01:35:08] woman who had worked with him at his

[01:35:10] ranch

[01:35:12] in my first week there i delivered a

[01:35:14] plate of food to

[01:35:16] a resident in one of the trailers and i

[01:35:18] remember seeing he had

[01:35:20] a tumor on the back of his head after

[01:35:23] about a month or two he had checked out

[01:35:26] he was ready to go home and there was

[01:35:28] nothing but a smooth

[01:35:29] piece of gauze there like it had just

[01:35:32] melted away

[01:35:33] um i remember just looking through the

[01:35:37] news one morning and seeing an article

[01:35:38] about a doctor from

[01:35:40] valley center who had been arrested or

[01:35:42] who was on trial

[01:35:43] and when i clicked on it i couldn't

[01:35:46] believe

[01:35:47] who it was

[01:35:50] it just seemed it makes me feel a bit

[01:35:54] emotional actually

[01:35:56] it seemed very

[01:36:00] wrong for somebody who

[01:36:04] just wanted to heal and help people

[01:36:08] to be put through that

[01:36:11] [Music]

[01:36:14] my approach is to educate and empower

[01:36:16] people on how to take care of their

[01:36:17] bodies

[01:36:18] it's a self-care self-care program

[01:36:22] that we can have a debate is important

[01:36:26] that we can talk about this openly

[01:36:29] without being threatened on either side

[01:36:33] when we first heard about doctor young i

[01:36:36] looked him up on the internet

[01:36:37] and it made him look like such a quack

[01:36:41] i called my friend who had initially

[01:36:43] turned me onto him to say what's up with

[01:36:45] this guy

[01:36:46] and he said look i traveled with him for

[01:36:49] a year

[01:36:50] and watched a lot of people including my

[01:36:53] mother

[01:36:54] heal from stage four metastasized cancer

[01:36:57] you have to check him out it's totally

[01:37:00] humbling to see how impactful it is when

[01:37:03] slander is used to marginalize

[01:37:06] these breakthroughs even i fell into it

[01:37:09] and i've been slandered myself

[01:37:12] so why and by whom

[01:37:15] are these innovations being suppressed

[01:37:18] is this just random bullying and

[01:37:20] corruption

[01:37:21] according to our research transformative

[01:37:23] breakthroughs in

[01:37:24] every sector are being systematically

[01:37:26] stifled

[01:37:28] in order to centralize authority

[01:37:31] in our previous thrive film we detailed

[01:37:33] our conclusion that this suppression is

[01:37:35] the result of a well-organized agenda

[01:37:38] that is carried out through systems put

[01:37:40] in place at the highest levels

[01:37:42] of banking government medicine

[01:37:46] food energy and information

[01:37:51] our investigations confirm that those

[01:37:53] seeking world domination

[01:37:55] sometimes referred to as the globalist

[01:37:57] cabal

[01:37:59] have the goal to suppress innovations in

[01:38:02] order to manipulate what we have

[01:38:05] what we know and what we do

[01:38:09] their agenda is not a thriving world for

[01:38:12] everyone

[01:38:13] but global control by an elite few

[01:38:23] in thrive one we presented over 60

[01:38:25] controversial facts

[01:38:27] detailing the structures and the

[01:38:28] strategies by which this agenda for

[01:38:31] control is being implemented

[01:38:33] not one of these facts has been

[01:38:35] successfully disputed

[01:38:38] the globalist intent is to take down

[01:38:41] america

[01:38:42] and any other powerful country in order

[01:38:45] to establish essentially

[01:38:47] a universal banking corporation to rule

[01:38:50] the world

[01:38:52] the agenda is playing out like clockwork

[01:38:54] as we navigate the measures put in place

[01:38:57] as a result of the corona virus

[01:39:00] abiding by new government mandates makes

[01:39:02] sense to most people

[01:39:04] to protect against the spread of what

[01:39:06] we're told is an extremely contagious

[01:39:08] disease

[01:39:09] but giving up rights has profound

[01:39:12] consequences under

[01:39:13] any circumstances in fact claiming our

[01:39:17] rights is at the core

[01:39:18] of our ability to get breakthrough

[01:39:20] innovations out

[01:39:22] to create vibrant local communities

[01:39:25] and even to choose what we do with our

[01:39:27] own bodies

[01:39:29] how does someone get a right who gives

[01:39:32] it

[01:39:33] who takes it away the question of rights

[01:39:37] really revolves around the issue of

[01:39:38] authority

[01:39:40] authority means the right to rule

[01:39:44] not just the ability to control somebody

[01:39:46] but the right to forcibly dominate

[01:39:49] other people so how does somebody get

[01:39:52] this

[01:39:53] legal authority this right

[01:40:02] if i as a single human being

[01:40:06] can't legally stop you from taking a

[01:40:08] medicine that you believe will help you

[01:40:12] then why and how does a government

[01:40:14] official claim the right to do it

[01:40:17] there's both a rational and a moral

[01:40:20] incoherence here

[01:40:22] if i don't have the moral right to do a

[01:40:24] certain thing

[01:40:26] and my neighbor doesn't have the right

[01:40:27] to do it either how could we possibly

[01:40:29] have given

[01:40:30] somebody else government or anybody else

[01:40:32] the right to do it

[01:40:33] morality doesn't work that way if it's

[01:40:35] wrong for me and him and him and him and

[01:40:36] him and him

[01:40:37] it's wrong for anybody including

[01:40:39] government even if they have

[01:40:41] constitutions even if they have

[01:40:42] elections even if they call it

[01:40:43] legislation

[01:40:44] it's still wrong you can't make

[01:40:46] something bad into something good by

[01:40:48] doing a bunch of

[01:40:49] weird pseudo-religious rituals and

[01:40:52] calling it law

[01:40:53] it's still wrong

[01:40:57] the majority of people who enable

[01:41:01] authoritarian injustice are not trying

[01:41:04] to be bad but they've been taught to

[01:41:05] believe that obedience is a virtue that

[01:41:07] paying your taxes is a good thing that

[01:41:09] obeying the law is a good thing

[01:41:11] and so you get a bunch of

[01:41:12] well-intentioned decent people

[01:41:15] accidentally enabling evil because

[01:41:17] ruling classes don't pay for themselves

[01:41:19] they don't fund themselves

[01:41:23] you would never convince people to reach

[01:41:25] in their pockets and come up with the

[01:41:27] money to go invade seven countries in

[01:41:29] the middle east

[01:41:31] it would never happen without the notion

[01:41:34] of

[01:41:34] centralized authority as a state as an

[01:41:37] authoritarian government

[01:41:42] [Music]

[01:41:44] we've got clean ways to access energy

[01:41:47] natural ways to prevent and heal illness

[01:41:50] and tools to accelerate our expanding

[01:41:53] consciousness

[01:41:56] and yet i believe unraveling this belief

[01:42:00] in authority

[01:42:01] holds the most important key to our

[01:42:03] survival

[01:42:05] the government and the state is

[01:42:07] particularly challenging

[01:42:08] because it takes away the interpersonal

[01:42:11] nature of violence which is one of the

[01:42:13] things that limits violence

[01:42:14] so it's the outsourcing of violence

[01:42:16] which tends to make it escalate

[01:42:18] some people have the idea that if

[01:42:21] something is legal it's moral

[01:42:23] all of the persecution of the jews in

[01:42:25] nazi germany were legal

[01:42:28] but i think few people would say that it

[01:42:30] was moral

[01:42:33] that's what government does it tries to

[01:42:36] make

[01:42:37] immoral moral by giving it

[01:42:40] the blessing of legality

[01:42:43] [Music]

[01:42:48] more than 200 million people were killed

[01:42:52] just by their own governments not even

[01:42:54] counting war in the last hundred years

[01:42:57] and obviously that's

[01:42:58] not what proponents of government want

[01:43:01] there are two giant cons and if we

[01:43:04] understand

[01:43:04] these we can understand the predicament

[01:43:07] we're in

[01:43:08] and the way to get free the first one is

[01:43:12] the myth of authority

[01:43:14] if you can convince people that someone

[01:43:17] should be ruling over them

[01:43:19] then all you have to do is make sure

[01:43:20] you're the one

[01:43:23] the second is money once you've secured

[01:43:27] the authority to rule over

[01:43:28] others then you can take over the money

[01:43:31] system

[01:43:31] and manipulate it to maintain your

[01:43:33] control

[01:43:35] with the monopoly on force which

[01:43:37] governments have

[01:43:38] and the ability to tax and to print

[01:43:41] money

[01:43:42] a small group can potentially take over

[01:43:45] everything

[01:43:46] and everyone

[01:43:50] despite their rhetoric governments

[01:43:52] always look to expand their power

[01:43:54] and increase their control until people

[01:43:57] revolt

[01:43:58] and when a revolution brings a new

[01:44:00] regime into power

[01:44:01] it's not long until that regime begins

[01:44:04] to expand

[01:44:04] that power until the cycle just repeats

[01:44:07] all over again

[01:44:09] replace expand revolt

[01:44:13] repeat across the globe people are

[01:44:17] frustrated and protesting and they're

[01:44:20] frustrated with

[01:44:21] protesting from occupy

[01:44:24] yoloves and hong kong to venezuela

[01:44:28] brazil china brexit the united states

[01:44:32] and

[01:44:32] countless others what is the resolution

[01:44:36] that's missing

[01:44:38] we propose that it's to reclaim

[01:44:41] individual sovereignty

[01:44:43] and create protective rules without any

[01:44:46] authoritarian rulers

[01:44:49] we've come a long way from the pharaohs

[01:44:52] kings and dictators

[01:44:54] to the president's premiers and prime

[01:44:57] ministers of today

[01:44:59] but we're not there yet

[01:45:02] democracy even if it were honest

[01:45:05] is still majority or mob rule

[01:45:10] you still have up to 49 percent

[01:45:12] dissatisfied

[01:45:15] the one thing we haven't tried is true

[01:45:18] equality of opportunity based on

[01:45:21] non-aggression

[01:45:22] with everyone accountable for their

[01:45:24] actions and

[01:45:26] no one authorized to rule over anyone

[01:45:28] else

[01:45:30] the idea of our being accountable to

[01:45:32] moral rules

[01:45:34] instead of rulers has been brewing for a

[01:45:37] long time

[01:45:39] epicurus called it natural justice

[01:45:44] john locke in the 1680s called it

[01:45:46] natural law

[01:45:48] being all equal and independent

[01:45:51] herbert spencer in the 1850s called it

[01:45:54] equal freedom

[01:45:55] and gandhi called it hinswaraj meaning

[01:45:59] self-governance it's most commonly now

[01:46:02] referred to as the non-aggression

[01:46:04] principle a simple rule where no one

[01:46:07] gets to initiate force against

[01:46:09] anyone else against their will

[01:46:12] except in true self-defense

[01:46:15] when we put this principle to the test

[01:46:17] of ethics

[01:46:18] and of a universal morality it

[01:46:22] holds up it's the one thing we've found

[01:46:25] that everyone agrees on

[01:46:27] at least for themselves in the same way

[01:46:31] the taurus is the universal basis for

[01:46:33] sustainable energy systems

[01:46:36] the non-aggression principle seems to me

[01:46:39] to be the most

[01:46:40] coherent and logical candidate for the

[01:46:43] basis

[01:46:44] of a universal morality non-aggression

[01:46:47] is the social practice of resonance

[01:46:55] what if the non-initiation of force was

[01:46:57] a universal constant for all human

[01:46:59] beings

[01:47:00] now some people may violate it for sure

[01:47:02] but what if it was understood

[01:47:03] as a moral law what would change in our

[01:47:06] conception of society well you can't

[01:47:07] have a state because the state violates

[01:47:09] the non-aggression principle

[01:47:10] and people say well that's freaky

[01:47:13] absolutely you know what else is freaky

[01:47:14] quantum physics

[01:47:16] and if you don't want the effects of

[01:47:17] quantum physics you can't use a cell

[01:47:19] phone

[01:47:19] you can't use a computer because they

[01:47:20] run on some principles derived from

[01:47:22] quantum physics

[01:47:23] what matters is is it moral is it true

[01:47:25] is it valid

[01:47:26] and it is a non-aggression principle

[01:47:28] should be universal

[01:47:30] we tell our kids don't hit other

[01:47:32] children and don't take their stuff

[01:47:35] then our governments do exactly that

[01:47:38] and with the majority of parents

[01:47:40] worldwide still claiming that a good

[01:47:42] hard spanking is sometimes necessary

[01:47:45] we need to take a good hard look at why

[01:47:47] this violence is condoned

[01:47:50] when it comes to the non-aggression

[01:47:51] principle

[01:47:53] we should apply it the most to the

[01:47:56] greatest prevalence of violence

[01:47:58] and to society's most vulnerable members

[01:48:01] which means that the non-aggression

[01:48:02] principle should apply first and

[01:48:04] foremost

[01:48:05] to the family if children are raised

[01:48:08] peacefully

[01:48:09] the odds of them becoming violent adults

[01:48:12] are virtually nil if you want a peaceful

[01:48:15] world

[01:48:16] treating children respectfully

[01:48:19] peacefully

[01:48:21] that is where the real gold of the

[01:48:22] future lies

[01:48:34] the supposed legitimacy of some people

[01:48:37] having rights

[01:48:38] that we don't all have is so pervasive

[01:48:42] so unquestioned so woven into the fabric

[01:48:46] of our lives

[01:48:47] that to unpack it let alone transform it

[01:48:51] really requires shaken things up it was

[01:48:54] my grandmother emilia who taught me

[01:48:56] about critical thinking

[01:48:58] she said you have to be able to try on

[01:49:01] an idea

[01:49:02] like you try on an outfit in the store

[01:49:05] you don't have to buy it you can even

[01:49:07] take it home

[01:49:08] and then later return it well she lived

[01:49:11] to be 103

[01:49:13] and said there is no way she could have

[01:49:15] navigated all the changes that happened

[01:49:17] in her lifetime

[01:49:18] if she hadn't learned how to suspend

[01:49:21] disbelief

[01:49:22] and temporarily hold conflicting views

[01:49:26] long enough to determine the highest

[01:49:28] truth

[01:49:30] so i've done that with the issue of

[01:49:32] unequal rights

[01:49:33] the basis of authority and the highest

[01:49:37] truth i've come up with

[01:49:39] is that equal individual accountability

[01:49:43] is the cornerstone of freedom and

[01:49:46] thriving

[01:49:48] in fact i believe integrity is to a

[01:49:51] person

[01:49:52] what resonance is to the field the

[01:49:56] definition of integrity

[01:49:58] is the state of being whole and

[01:50:01] undivided unified

[01:50:08] self-ownership is sort of a shorthand

[01:50:11] way to describe

[01:50:12] a very basic principle that almost

[01:50:14] everybody just understands instinctively

[01:50:17] to say i own myself it might sound a

[01:50:19] little bit schizophrenic like i'm a

[01:50:21] table or something

[01:50:22] but ownership means to have the

[01:50:24] exclusive right to decide what is done

[01:50:26] with something

[01:50:27] and so when i say self-ownership i just

[01:50:29] mean i

[01:50:30] get to decide what's done with this and

[01:50:32] what's done with my mind and my body and

[01:50:34] my

[01:50:34] my time and my effort and the same is

[01:50:36] true of every other

[01:50:37] individual so most people instinctively

[01:50:40] grasp the concept of consent

[01:50:43] and we all know that but we're taught

[01:50:45] that there's an exception when it comes

[01:50:47] to

[01:50:47] the law in authority and government

[01:50:51] this is especially clear with measures

[01:50:53] imposed to track

[01:50:54] and address covet 19 including

[01:50:57] increased funding for the rollout of 5g

[01:51:01] that empowers the internet of things to

[01:51:04] turn what we think of as appliances

[01:51:06] into tracking devices in our homes and

[01:51:09] schools

[01:51:11] there are known adverse health effects

[01:51:13] especially to children

[01:51:15] of 5g yet over 20 000 satellites are now

[01:51:19] set to

[01:51:20] blanket the globe pulsing

[01:51:22] electromagnetic radiation from the

[01:51:24] ionosphere

[01:51:26] the new 5g technology will also have

[01:51:29] millions of ground antennae immersing

[01:51:31] people in a toxic

[01:51:33] sea of microwaves if there's no

[01:51:36] voluntary

[01:51:37] choice there's no self-ownership

[01:51:40] no freedom

[01:51:46] i'm not so sure that the that the reason

[01:51:49] for rolling out 5g

[01:51:51] is connected to um profit per se

[01:51:55] but when you talk in terms of dragnet

[01:51:58] surveillance

[01:51:59] and being able to

[01:52:02] dial in to the frequency of

[01:52:05] a an individual and to be able to target

[01:52:09] them in their own home

[01:52:10] and see them through steel and concrete

[01:52:13] from satellite

[01:52:14] 24 hours a day we've taken

[01:52:17] electronic totalitarianism to its

[01:52:20] absolute acme point

[01:52:24] remember zenic technology has the

[01:52:26] potential to get us

[01:52:28] fast data transfer speed without these

[01:52:31] negative effects

[01:52:33] a sovereign individual believes we own

[01:52:35] our own thoughts

[01:52:37] our bodies and the fruits of our labor

[01:52:42] being sovereign doesn't deny our social

[01:52:44] nature

[01:52:45] or our essential need and desire to care

[01:52:48] for one another

[01:52:50] on the contrary sovereignty is the

[01:52:52] foundation

[01:52:54] for all people having equal rights and

[01:52:56] equal opportunity

[01:52:59] [Music]

[01:53:02] the drive towards centralizing authority

[01:53:04] over our lives

[01:53:06] shows up in every sector in thrive one

[01:53:09] we created a checklist of what the

[01:53:11] globalists would need to control

[01:53:13] to achieve their goal of complete

[01:53:15] domination

[01:53:16] let's check in on the status of that

[01:53:20] with energy we showed that this elite

[01:53:22] cartel

[01:53:23] already controlled oil gas

[01:53:26] coal and nuclear and were suppressing

[01:53:29] new energy

[01:53:30] because it would undermine their

[01:53:32] consolidation of power

[01:53:36] we came to see that in each sector

[01:53:38] there's an escape route from the matrix

[01:53:41] a release valve for humanity and it's

[01:53:44] always characterized by strengthening

[01:53:47] individual sovereignty

[01:53:49] decentralizing power and harmoniously

[01:53:53] aligning with the principles of the

[01:53:54] field

[01:54:02] here's our prior checklist for health

[01:54:05] except for natural and alternative

[01:54:07] treatments

[01:54:08] the controlling elite have it all locked

[01:54:10] down

[01:54:12] currently the risk involved in providing

[01:54:14] alternatives is serious

[01:54:17] an inordinate number of holistic doctors

[01:54:20] in the u.s

[01:54:21] have died mysteriously in the last

[01:54:23] several years

[01:54:24] many of whom were working on natural

[01:54:27] cancer treatments

[01:54:28] or exposing the link between vaccines

[01:54:31] and brain damage

[01:54:35] the other two most effective doctors we

[01:54:37] met

[01:54:38] whose results we saw curing cancer

[01:54:41] including in some of our friends are now

[01:54:44] in hiding in other countries

[01:54:45] after assassination attempts on their

[01:54:48] lives in the u.s

[01:54:51] efforts to centralize continue the world

[01:54:54] health organization

[01:54:55] the cdc the gates foundation

[01:54:59] gavi microsoft google

[01:55:02] glaxosmithkline they're all in cahoots

[01:55:05] with this toxic

[01:55:07] totalitarian takeover

[01:55:09] amazon is becoming an online

[01:55:12] pharmaceutical dealer

[01:55:13] which i suspect is part of what's behind

[01:55:15] their censoring information about

[01:55:17] natural remedies

[01:55:19] monsanto is now operating under the

[01:55:21] auspices of bear

[01:55:23] so environmental toxins that make you

[01:55:25] sick and the companies who sell you

[01:55:27] drugs to manage the symptoms

[01:55:30] are all in one big funnel which is why

[01:55:33] they're intimidating and eliminating

[01:55:35] those who would bring

[01:55:36] non-pharmaceutical natural healing

[01:55:40] what's the relief valve freedom to

[01:55:44] explore

[01:55:44] ever new breakthroughs in biology

[01:55:47] consciousness

[01:55:48] and resonance for radiant health

[01:55:55] when we were in china we went to this

[01:55:57] city called shenzhen

[01:55:59] where the u.s and other countries are

[01:56:01] testing surveillance technologies

[01:56:03] under the golden shield program

[01:56:06] these are the control tools that track

[01:56:08] people's every move

[01:56:10] to inform what is now known as the

[01:56:12] chinese social credit system

[01:56:15] under this system the government doles

[01:56:17] out or withholds

[01:56:19] normal rights accessing your bank

[01:56:21] account

[01:56:22] buying certain goods or getting on a

[01:56:24] plane

[01:56:25] based on obedience to the state

[01:56:29] this is technocracy run amok

[01:56:33] this is scientific dictatorship

[01:56:39] the gift of life is calling and guiding

[01:56:42] us toward harmonious fulfillment

[01:56:44] of our human potential for creativity

[01:56:47] cooperation and

[01:56:49] love not to surrender our conscious

[01:56:52] evolution to sociopathic control freaks

[01:56:55] or artificial intelligence robots

[01:56:58] we have to consciously change course to

[01:57:01] avoid this same rollout everywhere

[01:57:05] especially in the aftermath of covid19

[01:57:08] which is being used to collapse

[01:57:11] economies

[01:57:12] expand surveillance impose

[01:57:15] universal vaccines and justify

[01:57:19] global governance when i was vetting the

[01:57:22] new health technologies

[01:57:24] i noticed that many of the patients who

[01:57:26] were willing to explore the bold new

[01:57:29] approaches

[01:57:30] were the ones who had already exhausted

[01:57:32] traditional options

[01:57:34] and they were in stage four metastasized

[01:57:36] cancer

[01:57:38] i would say that right now life on this

[01:57:41] planet

[01:57:42] is in stage four metastases it's

[01:57:45] time to get bold

[01:57:49] when we dare to go deep enough down the

[01:57:51] rabbit hole

[01:57:52] to truly understand what is going on in

[01:57:55] the darkness behind closed doors

[01:57:57] it empowers us with the information we

[01:58:00] need

[01:58:01] to solve the huge problems we face

[01:58:04] there is light at the end of the rabbit

[01:58:07] hole

[01:58:08] everywhere there's a problem there are

[01:58:10] people working diligently and

[01:58:12] effectively to solve it

[01:58:14] people around the world are waking up to

[01:58:16] this issue of informed consent

[01:58:19] and more and more cities and counties

[01:58:21] are banning the dumping of

[01:58:23] brain-damaging fluoride into their water

[01:58:25] supplies

[01:58:26] perpetrators are getting exposed as

[01:58:29] they're going for official approval

[01:58:31] to do legally the atmospheric aerosol

[01:58:34] dumping that they've been doing covertly

[01:58:37] for more than two decades and as a

[01:58:39] result of organized pressure from people

[01:58:41] impacted by monsanto-bear's

[01:58:43] glyphosate herbicide it was finally

[01:58:46] reclassified as a carcinogen

[01:58:49] now it along with more and more

[01:58:52] genetically modified crops

[01:58:53] is being banned from counties and

[01:58:56] countries around the world

[01:58:58] protests are also emerging worldwide

[01:59:00] against the involuntary

[01:59:02] sickening radiation that comes with 5g

[01:59:07] the common theme to all of these

[01:59:09] solutions

[01:59:10] is restoring the wholeness of natural

[01:59:13] systems

[01:59:15] one of the most far-reaching actions we

[01:59:17] can take is to support

[01:59:19] organizations and countries working to

[01:59:22] establish

[01:59:23] legal rights for nature it would

[01:59:25] significantly help

[01:59:27] limit pollution and restore ecosystems

[01:59:31] of course we all need to access

[01:59:33] resources from our environment to

[01:59:35] survive

[01:59:36] but we can prevent the destruction of

[01:59:38] ecosystems in the process

[01:59:40] and we need to all life matters

[01:59:46] centralized money is pretty much the

[01:59:49] linchpin of the entire domination agenda

[01:59:52] primary perpetrators tend to be in the

[01:59:54] financial industry because it's the

[01:59:56] money

[01:59:56] that gives them the ability to control

[01:59:58] politicians

[02:00:00] who control the military who control

[02:00:03] people

[02:00:04] they've almost completed their plan to

[02:00:06] have the entire world

[02:00:07] funneled through one debt-based fiat

[02:00:11] currency system

[02:00:28] the countries attacked in the middle

[02:00:30] east under the guise of so-called regime

[02:00:33] change since being invaded all have

[02:00:36] rothschild central banks

[02:00:38] when general wesley clark returned to

[02:00:42] after his retirement he had a shocking

[02:00:45] [Music]

[02:00:52] experience

[02:01:03] the only countries which have not been

[02:01:05] absorbed into this banking scheme

[02:01:07] are in the crosshairs iran north korea

[02:01:10] and cuba having money backed by

[02:01:14] something real

[02:01:16] known as asset-backed currency prevents

[02:01:19] the global cabal from controlling people

[02:01:21] through money they can just make up out

[02:01:22] of nothing

[02:01:24] the basis of what's known as fiat

[02:01:25] currency

[02:01:28] countries all over the world are

[02:01:30] increasing their use of gold back money

[02:01:32] to help prevent this takeover while

[02:01:36] their goal may not be equal rights for

[02:01:38] all they are at least after a

[02:01:40] multi-polar world

[02:01:42] unlike the globalists who want to rule

[02:01:44] it all

[02:01:46] brazil russia india

[02:01:50] china and south africa have created an

[02:01:52] alliance

[02:01:53] that represents a block close to the

[02:01:55] size of nato and nearly

[02:01:57] half of gross domestic production across

[02:01:59] the planet

[02:02:01] they're doing multi-billion dollar deals

[02:02:03] especially for oil

[02:02:05] that are being settled in gold and

[02:02:07] gold-backed yuan

[02:02:08] the currency of china at their

[02:02:11] invitation kimberly and i met with

[02:02:13] various leaders of the asian dragon

[02:02:15] alliance

[02:02:16] an ancient confederation of royal

[02:02:18] families from china

[02:02:19] japan indonesia the philippines

[02:02:22] and vietnam this alliance is

[02:02:25] spearheading a return to asset-backed

[02:02:27] currencies

[02:02:28] worldwide they've been mining and

[02:02:30] collecting off-record gold troves for

[02:02:33] centuries

[02:02:34] they helped to create the asia

[02:02:36] infrastructure investment bank

[02:02:38] backed by 200 billion dollars in gold as

[02:02:40] an alternative to the imf and world bank

[02:02:43] which have destroyed the economies of so

[02:02:45] many countries with their unrepayable

[02:02:47] loans

[02:02:49] they've also helped to create the

[02:02:50] shanghai gold exchange

[02:02:52] which deals in real precious metal

[02:02:54] assets rather than the fiat paper scams

[02:02:57] by which big banks have been

[02:02:59] manipulating metals markets for years

[02:03:05] fortunately decentralized alternatives

[02:03:08] are emerging

[02:03:09] innovators all over the world are

[02:03:11] creating authentic

[02:03:13] blockchain and asset-backed alternative

[02:03:18] [Music]

[02:03:26] currencies

[02:03:30] constricting information through one

[02:03:32] centralized source

[02:03:34] is the antithesis of how the field works

[02:03:37] and how sustainable systems really work

[02:03:41] our

[02:03:42] education media and even our scientific

[02:03:46] inquiry are funneled through the same

[02:03:48] centralized control grid

[02:03:51] just as alternative technologies are

[02:03:53] being kept from us

[02:03:55] so are alternative perspectives

[02:03:59] one curriculum taught one scientific

[02:04:02] worldview accepted

[02:04:03] left and right media are essentially

[02:04:06] owned and sponsored by the same handful

[02:04:08] of companies and censorship

[02:04:10] is ramping up daily what's being

[02:04:13] censored

[02:04:15] the people and content that would

[02:04:17] empower

[02:04:18] us as individuals with information and

[02:04:21] tools

[02:04:22] that support our freedom

[02:04:28] the ultimate empowering of individuals

[02:04:30] happens with information

[02:04:33] the unified field itself is essentially

[02:04:36] an

[02:04:36] information transfer system at every

[02:04:39] scale

[02:04:40] constant feedback is what enables any

[02:04:43] system to thrive

[02:04:45] be it a body an organization

[02:04:48] an ecosystem or a civilization

[02:04:52] the battles of everyday people have so

[02:04:54] far kept the internet

[02:04:56] open and free enough that countless

[02:04:59] truth media sources

[02:05:01] are becoming available that are beyond

[02:05:03] partisan politics

[02:05:05] in their authentic search for facts

[02:05:08] evidence

[02:05:09] and common sense the following of many

[02:05:12] of them is rivaling and surpassing that

[02:05:15] of so-called mainstream news

[02:05:20] as effective as the consolidation has

[02:05:22] been there are many areas where the

[02:05:24] agenda is being revealed

[02:05:26] and people are refusing to tolerate it

[02:05:29] so far we've been effective against

[02:05:30] governments and corporations

[02:05:32] who try to get rfid chips into our

[02:05:35] bodies

[02:05:36] by which they could further track and

[02:05:37] control us

[02:05:39] there are growing movements to expose

[02:05:41] pedophilia rings and stop

[02:05:43] child sex trafficking in canada the

[02:05:46] netherlands

[02:05:47] australia belgium the uk

[02:05:50] the us and elsewhere in addition to the

[02:05:53] horrific abuse of innocent children

[02:05:56] these networks are used by the cabal to

[02:05:58] get photos of influential people

[02:06:00] engaged in sex with minors which they

[02:06:03] use as blackmail to keep the control

[02:06:06] agenda in place

[02:06:07] also on the progress list even before

[02:06:10] the closing of schools in the 2020

[02:06:12] pandemic

[02:06:13] there were already increasing

[02:06:15] educational options

[02:06:17] to replace the mandatory indoctrination

[02:06:19] of traditional government schools

[02:06:23] and through the hard work and tenacity

[02:06:26] of independent journalists and truth

[02:06:27] seekers

[02:06:29] marginalized topics are now beginning to

[02:06:31] go mainstream

[02:06:33] even the new york times cnn and the

[02:06:36] vatican have all

[02:06:37] finally confirmed that yes there are

[02:06:39] videos

[02:06:40] and other official sightings of ufos

[02:06:44] and that whoever is making these ships

[02:06:46] has capabilities way beyond anything in

[02:06:49] the known military fleet

[02:06:51] there's a whole fleet

[02:06:54] oh my gosh

[02:07:02] this was extremely abrupt like a ping

[02:07:03] pong ball bouncing off a wall the

[02:07:05] ability to hover over the water and then

[02:07:06] start a vertical climb from

[02:07:08] basically zero up towards about twelve

[02:07:10] thousand feet and then

[02:07:11] accelerate in less than two seconds and

[02:07:13] disappear is

[02:07:15] something i had never seen in my life

[02:07:18] while we are making progress on many

[02:07:20] fronts

[02:07:21] the reality of our global

[02:07:23] interconnectedness

[02:07:24] is very different from a global

[02:07:26] government

[02:07:28] a global government would need to get

[02:07:30] all of us to financially support it

[02:07:33] fear of a global pandemic can increase

[02:07:36] people's willingness to buy into this

[02:07:38] global authority

[02:07:40] anyone concerned about the risks of

[02:07:42] forfeiting rights

[02:07:43] is shamed for not caring about the

[02:07:45] health of their fellow citizens

[02:07:47] just like anyone questioning the science

[02:07:49] behind the failing global warming models

[02:07:52] or mentioning the obvious role of the

[02:07:54] sun is condemned for not caring about

[02:07:57] the environment

[02:07:59] as we laid out in thrive one the

[02:08:01] globalist

[02:08:02] end goal is to centralize law

[02:08:06] money and police enforcement into one

[02:08:09] totalitarian command structure

[02:08:11] with energy as its control currency

[02:08:14] this centralization goes by many names

[02:08:17] agenda 21

[02:08:19] 2030 global governance the new world

[02:08:22] order

[02:08:23] all under the guise of the rothschild

[02:08:25] rockefeller created

[02:08:27] united nations

[02:08:35] free energy would do more to obsolete

[02:08:37] toxic fossil fuel emissions

[02:08:39] than anything on the table there are

[02:08:42] ways to address our obvious need to

[02:08:44] control pollution

[02:08:46] without creating a tax base for global

[02:08:49] tyranny

[02:08:52] giving up our rights for the supposed

[02:08:54] good of the group

[02:08:56] appeals to our natural compassion and

[02:08:58] goodness

[02:08:59] and leads to our own demise the core

[02:09:03] struggle for a thriving civilization

[02:09:05] is not between nations political parties

[02:09:10] races genders or classes but between

[02:09:13] those who want to be

[02:09:14] free and those who would continue to

[02:09:17] steal freedom

[02:09:18] from us the justification for initiating

[02:09:20] violence comes in different forms

[02:09:23] but the outcome is always the same

[02:09:26] the nazis endorsed it for racial

[02:09:28] preference

[02:09:30] the communists condoned it on behalf of

[02:09:32] a social class

[02:09:34] the social democracies claim the right

[02:09:36] to initiate force

[02:09:37] whenever they deem it serves the common

[02:09:44] good

[02:09:51] by giving up our authority and allowing

[02:09:54] ourselves to be controlled by

[02:09:56] unethical policies instead of rational

[02:10:00] moral principles we find ourselves in a

[02:10:03] situation

[02:10:04] where energy is controlled health

[02:10:07] options are inadequate

[02:10:09] media is censored money's centralized

[02:10:12] education is limited and now

[02:10:15] our ability to control our own

[02:10:17] businesses

[02:10:18] our property and ourselves is at stake

[02:10:24] the definition of socialism is

[02:10:27] government

[02:10:28] taking over the means of production

[02:10:31] that means all products and services

[02:10:35] transportation education

[02:10:38] manufacturing food agriculture

[02:10:42] media energy money health care

[02:10:45] and more in recent times

[02:10:49] it's democratic socialism that's touted

[02:10:52] as the system by which

[02:10:53] most people will be cared for and

[02:10:55] prosper

[02:10:56] but systems based on unequal rights

[02:11:00] will never meet the needs of most people

[02:11:03] in the long run

[02:11:04] it doesn't work that way millions of

[02:11:07] people

[02:11:07] throughout the united states and all

[02:11:09] over the world

[02:11:10] rely on government for their basic needs

[02:11:13] the point isn't to abandon these people

[02:11:16] it's to develop strategies for

[02:11:18] transition to a free world

[02:11:21] that empowers them instead of additional

[02:11:24] taxes

[02:11:25] which social democracy relies on why

[02:11:28] don't we

[02:11:28] require that our tax money be redirected

[02:11:32] away from wars of aggression to provide

[02:11:35] goods and services to those who

[02:11:37] genuinely need them along with training

[02:11:40] that could empower those who can

[02:11:42] to become independent more than 100

[02:11:46] million people were starved

[02:11:48] tortured and killed under the socialist

[02:11:51] regimes of hitler's germany

[02:11:53] stalin's russia mao's china

[02:11:56] paul potts cambodia kim jong-uns north

[02:12:00] korea

[02:12:01] chavez's venezuela

[02:12:04] this isn't what social democrats want

[02:12:07] but as chairman mao said

[02:12:09] relinquishing our self-rule and freedom

[02:12:11] to innovate

[02:12:12] into the hands of government is the

[02:12:14] stepping stone to communism

[02:12:17] where instead of just controlling

[02:12:19] everything the government

[02:12:21] also owns it

[02:12:24] pro-socialists of any age either don't

[02:12:27] know about this or they somehow believe

[02:12:30] this time it will be different promising

[02:12:34] to provide free health care and services

[02:12:37] for those in need with money from

[02:12:39] wealthy people

[02:12:40] is how all the socialist regimes started

[02:12:44] history proves this clearly there are a

[02:12:48] ton

[02:12:49] of people in need on our planet

[02:12:52] empowering them with long-term

[02:12:55] self-sustaining solutions that's

[02:12:58] our real challenge it's not a problem

[02:13:02] of just lacking enlightened leadership

[02:13:05] the

[02:13:05] fundamental violation at the basis of

[02:13:08] socialism

[02:13:09] is a fatal systemic moral

[02:13:13] and economic flaw the solutions to

[02:13:17] virtually

[02:13:18] all our problems come through alignment

[02:13:21] with the flow

[02:13:22] of the energy in the field

[02:13:24] centralization of power

[02:13:26] and restriction of information are the

[02:13:29] exact

[02:13:31] opposites of what works

[02:13:35] after two decades of research into these

[02:13:38] questions

[02:13:38] i'm confident that all of the challenges

[02:13:41] we face are

[02:13:42] way better served by independent

[02:13:44] providers

[02:13:45] in a true free market than by a small

[02:13:48] group with a monopoly on force

[02:13:50] and money this is the essence of

[02:13:53] voluntarism

[02:13:55] a principle for organizing that finally

[02:13:57] transcends the political polarization

[02:14:01] the struggle for power over others that

[02:14:04] threatens our very existence

[02:14:07] as martin luther king jr said the ark of

[02:14:09] the moral universe is long

[02:14:12] but it bends toward justice

[02:14:18] imagine a future civilization with

[02:14:21] protective rules

[02:14:23] yet without rulers with no authoritarian

[02:14:27] rule of government

[02:14:28] imagine what goes away

[02:14:32] imagine it

[02:14:41] [Music]

[02:15:05] [Music]

[02:15:16] the pain of our current inequality and

[02:15:19] planetary destruction

[02:15:20] cannot legitimately be laid at the feet

[02:15:23] of capitalism

[02:15:24] because we don't have free market

[02:15:27] capitalism

[02:15:28] we have state intervention centrally

[02:15:31] controlled

[02:15:33] subsidy ridden bailout bailout-backed

[02:15:36] military-enforced banker-skewed

[02:15:39] legalized corruption crony corporatism

[02:15:44] to call what we have capitalism is an

[02:15:47] insult to honest workers

[02:15:49] managers entrepreneurs and investors

[02:15:52] whether it's steve jobs oprah winfrey or

[02:15:56] your children at their lemonade stand

[02:15:58] it is as arrogant unjust and dangerous

[02:16:02] to try to centrally manage an economy as

[02:16:05] it is to try to geo-engineer the weather

[02:16:09] a decentralized unsubsidized economy

[02:16:13] is a natural phenomenon

[02:16:16] people fulfill each other's needs

[02:16:18] through billions of daily voluntary

[02:16:20] exchanges

[02:16:22] just moving in this direction of mutual

[02:16:24] benefit

[02:16:25] and natural pricing has improved more

[02:16:28] people's standard of living

[02:16:30] than anything in history so who do you

[02:16:34] think

[02:16:34] should rule one person a small group

[02:16:39] a majority or should we each

[02:16:42] rule ourselves as long as we don't

[02:16:44] violate anyone else

[02:16:47] virtually everyone i've talked with says

[02:16:49] the latter

[02:16:54] understanding the myth of authority

[02:16:57] doesn't mean we can snap our fingers and

[02:16:59] just hope destructive corporations will

[02:17:02] stop plundering the planet

[02:17:03] on their own accord until we have

[02:17:06] true enforceable personal accountability

[02:17:10] some of these corporations need to be

[02:17:12] constrained

[02:17:14] and at this stage it's government

[02:17:16] regulations we necessarily rely on to

[02:17:18] constrain them

[02:17:20] even though it's government protection

[02:17:22] that gives them the power to do the

[02:17:24] damage in the first place

[02:17:27] another strategic step we can take to

[02:17:30] help empower individuals

[02:17:32] is to overturn what's called corporate

[02:17:34] personhood

[02:17:36] in 2010 the u.s supreme court ruled in

[02:17:40] the citizens united case

[02:17:42] that corporations can have the same

[02:17:44] rights as an individual human

[02:17:48] they can donate any amount of money to

[02:17:50] political campaigns

[02:17:52] based on the premise that money equals

[02:17:55] free speech

[02:17:59] as a result politicians often spend up

[02:18:02] to 70 percent of their time

[02:18:04] going after corporate campaign dollars

[02:18:07] and then doing whatever it takes to be

[02:18:09] accountable

[02:18:10] to the donors not to us

[02:18:13] and not to our planet whoa

[02:18:17] what if we don't tolerate this

[02:18:28] the non-aggression principle does not

[02:18:30] count on good behavior from everyone

[02:18:33] quite the contrary individual

[02:18:35] accountability

[02:18:37] enforced by rules curtails bad behavior

[02:18:41] unlike what we have now that essentially

[02:18:44] rewards corruption

[02:18:46] and promotes those who best serve the

[02:18:48] controlling agenda

[02:18:51] all of these deceptive and coercive

[02:18:53] funnels

[02:18:54] lead to the inevitable suffering and

[02:18:57] death

[02:18:58] that socialism communism and

[02:19:01] fascism inflict

[02:19:04] government expands its power at the

[02:19:06] expense of individuals

[02:19:08] because protecting itself is its primary

[02:19:12] job

[02:19:14] the job of enlightened rules is to

[02:19:17] protect

[02:19:17] people and the planet the transition

[02:19:21] toward a condition of true freedom

[02:19:24] and ultimately a rules but no rulers

[02:19:27] stateless society

[02:19:28] is happening naturally and as fast as it

[02:19:31] is allowed

[02:19:34] [Music]

[02:19:44] in the united states already over 90

[02:19:47] of civil cases are resolved through

[02:19:50] alternative dispute mediation

[02:19:52] rather than the government courts i was

[02:19:55] astounded and encouraged to learn that

[02:19:57] there are already

[02:19:59] more independent peacekeepers in malls

[02:20:02] corporations hotels schools

[02:20:05] and communities than there are

[02:20:07] government police

[02:20:09] not only do the rest of us vastly

[02:20:11] outnumber the perpetrators of the global

[02:20:13] domination agenda

[02:20:15] by more than a million to one but the

[02:20:18] unified field itself

[02:20:20] is on our side truth

[02:20:24] reason virtue compassion

[02:20:27] these are the real life superpowers that

[02:20:30] emerge when you align with the field

[02:20:33] on the other hand those who would want

[02:20:34] to control or destroy us

[02:20:36] they're trying to go up against the

[02:20:38] entire unified field

[02:20:42] principles not politics are the way out

[02:20:48] the existence of a field our

[02:20:49] relationship to the field the ability to

[02:20:51] tap the potential of the field

[02:20:53] is what gives us the evolutionary edge

[02:20:55] that our ancestors never had

[02:20:57] the edge to not only survive but to

[02:21:00] thrive in the existence of the new world

[02:21:01] that's emerging

[02:21:02] the new world that you and i are

[02:21:05] designing because now we know

[02:21:06] about the field

[02:21:10] there are big systemic changes needed

[02:21:13] and it's easy to wonder

[02:21:15] how to begin i think the place to begin

[02:21:18] anything is with ourselves

[02:21:20] like the vast consciousness we exist

[02:21:23] within

[02:21:24] it starts with purpose our sector

[02:21:27] solutions wheel

[02:21:29] covers every area of human endeavor

[02:21:32] so once you have found your purpose and

[02:21:35] the sector you are most drawn to

[02:21:38] then look at issues in that area to

[02:21:40] identify

[02:21:41] which one best matches your skills and

[02:21:43] passion

[02:21:45] next consider which level of engagement

[02:21:48] best suits you

[02:21:49] right now is it working to meet

[02:21:51] immediate needs

[02:21:53] like helping someone who's hungry to get

[02:21:55] food

[02:21:57] improving systems like helping to create

[02:22:00] easier access to a broad range of health

[02:22:02] treatments

[02:22:03] or is it shifting consciousness helping

[02:22:06] to refine the world view

[02:22:08] that is at the root of them all aligning

[02:22:11] with the unified field

[02:22:13] can lead to an experience of resonance

[02:22:16] that we call

[02:22:16] love not a romantic crush kind of love

[02:22:20] but the big love coming into harmony

[02:22:23] with the life force itself

[02:22:26] applying reason and practice to

[02:22:29] unleashing our spiritual essence

[02:22:31] is what i call the science of love a

[02:22:34] finite set of skills

[02:22:36] to access this state of harmony these

[02:22:39] skills are physical

[02:22:41] emotional mental and interpersonal

[02:22:46] and it's possible to get good enough at

[02:22:48] each of them

[02:22:49] to experience a deeply fulfilling and

[02:22:52] effective life

[02:22:54] i believe these skills are not only

[02:22:56] obtainable

[02:22:58] but in fact evolving new abilities is

[02:23:00] ordained in our evolutionary code

[02:23:05] so what does it take a clear destination

[02:23:11] freedom a map of how to get there

[02:23:16] the arc of process

[02:23:20] a compass the non-aggression principle

[02:23:26] and a strategy

[02:23:29] restoring wholeness to natural systems

[02:23:33] aligning with the field

[02:23:36] [Music]

[02:23:38] we were born to do this we were born to

[02:23:42] thrive

[02:23:44] the same way there's no magic pill that

[02:23:47] can cure us

[02:23:48] if we don't deal with our lifestyle

[02:23:51] i don't believe there's any one person

[02:23:53] or group

[02:23:54] let alone some marvel superhero who can

[02:23:57] solve all our problems

[02:23:59] i just don't think we can outsource that

[02:24:02] capacity

[02:24:03] so what it means is that we're all in

[02:24:06] charge of coming up with this stuff

[02:24:08] ourselves

[02:24:09] and as daunting as it can feel it's

[02:24:12] actually good news

[02:24:14] because if it weren't up to us we'd be

[02:24:17] powerless

[02:24:18] and we're not we are as powerful as we

[02:24:23] allow ourselves to be

[02:24:26] we're not alone in this we are

[02:24:29] profoundly connected

[02:24:31] science and spirit both show that now

[02:24:35] and as the poet rumi reminds us

[02:24:38] remember you're not just a drop in the

[02:24:41] ocean

[02:24:42] you're the ocean in a drought

[02:24:56] [Music]

[02:25:03] [Music]

[02:25:22] [Music]

[02:25:28] [Music]

[02:25:36] uh

[02:25:39] [Music]

[02:26:01] repeating the earth is speaking

[02:26:05] saying time has come to wake

[02:26:08] up from this nightmare of lives

[02:26:14] so many shattered lives reaching out

[02:26:18] crying

[02:26:29] [Music]

[02:26:46] there's a

[02:26:47] [Music]

[02:27:13] beneath the noise there's an

[02:27:16] inner voice

[02:27:19] [Music]

[02:27:24] the veils are finally lifting

[02:27:26] [Music]

[02:27:42] knows

[02:27:44] [Music]

[02:27:54] stand up for a life

[02:28:01] [Music]

[02:28:15] stand up for our lives

[02:28:29] [Music]

[02:28:52] come together by the waters rise

[02:28:56] let us strain deep inside

[02:29:00] a deep inside we come together to stand

[02:29:03] up for our life

[02:29:09] we all have what it takes

[02:29:24] [Music]

[02:29:34] is

[02:29:39] [Music]

[02:29:49] have what is takes to thrive

[02:29:53] we all have what it takes to thrive

[02:30:05] [Music]

[02:30:44] tonight

[02:30:46] [Music]
