# 🎯 Super Simple Workflow

**Just use the `claude` command!**

---

## 🚀 One-Time Setup

```bash
# Add to your shell
echo "source '/Users/michaeldurante/ai dev/ce-hub/cehub-aliases.sh'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## 💬 That's It - Just Use Claude!

### Working on edge-dev?

```bash
# Go to project
cd "/Users/michaeldurante/ai dev/ce-hub/projects/edge-dev-main"

# Start working
# Just type in Claude Code what you want!
```

### Need to Transform a Message First?

```bash
# Transform and copy to clipboard
claude "fix the bug in scanner"

# Then paste into Claude Code
```

**That's literally it!** The auto-transform we set up handles everything else.
