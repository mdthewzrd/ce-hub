## 📖 How to Tag Any Product (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Identify Frame Style
Look at the product image/description and choose ONE:

```
□ Aviator     = Teardrop shape, double bridge
□ Cat-Eye     = Upswept outer corners
□ Round       = Perfect circles
□ Rectangle   = Elongated horizontal
□ Square      = Bold, equal width/height
□ Wayfarer    = Trapezoidal, wider at top
```

### Step 2: Add Style Tag
```
style:aviator       OR
style:cat_eye       OR
style:round         OR
style:rectangle     OR
style:square        OR
style:wayfarer
```

### Step 3: Add Material Tag
**Choose ONE:**
```
□ Wire/Metal       → material:wire
□ Acetate/Plastic  → material:acetate
```

### Step 4: Add Vibe Tags (Pick 2-3)
```
□ Retro       = Mentions 80s, 90s, vintage          → vibe:retro
□ Luxury      = Designer brand, expensive          → vibe:luxury
□ Modern      = Minimalist, clean, simple          → vibe:modern
□ Classic     = Timeless, traditional              → vibe:classic
□ Corporate   = Professional, office wear          → vibe:corporate
□ Trendy      = Fashion-forward, stylish           → vibe:trendy
□ Edgy        = Bold, unusual, dramatic             → vibe:edgy
```

### Step 5: Add Face Shape Tags
**Use the table above** - add 3-5 face shape tags based on frame style

```
□ Polarized mentioned        → lens:polarized
□ Prescription available     → lens:rx
