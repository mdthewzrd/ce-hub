## 🎯 Current Understanding (Needs Verification)

### Face Shape Identification

**OVAL Face**
- Characteristics: Forehead slightly wider than chin, balanced proportions
- Length: Approximately 1.5x width
- Most versatile face shape
- **Can wear: Almost any frame style**

**ROUND Face**
- Characteristics: Width ≈ Length, curved jawline, soft features
- Need: Angular frames to add definition and contrast
- **Best: Square, rectangle, wayfarer, cat-eye**
- **Avoid:** Round, small circular frames

**SQUARE Face**
- Characteristics: Strong jawline, forehead ≈ cheek width ≈ jaw width, angular features
- Need: Rounded/curved frames to soften angles
- **Best: Round, oval, cat-eye, aviator**
- **Avoid:** Sharp square, geometric frames

**HEART Face**
- Characteristics: Wider forehead, narrow chin, often high cheekbones
- Need: Bottom-heavy frames to balance width
- **Best:** Cat-eye, wayfarer, round, square (wider at bottom)
- **Avoid:** Top-heavy frames (decorative temples)

**DIAMOND Face**
- Characteristics: High cheekbones, narrow forehead and jaw
- Need: Frames that don't highlight cheekbones
- **Best:** Oval, cat-eye, rimless
- **Avoid:** Wide frames that accentuate cheekbones

**OBLONG/RECTANGLE Face**
- Characteristics: Longer than wide, often high forehead
- Need: Frames that break up length, add width
- **Best:** Wayfarer, oversized, decorative temples
- **Avoid:** Small, narrow frames

**TRIANGLE/Base-Down Face**
- Characteristics: Narrow forehead, wider jaw
- Need: Top-heavy frames to add forehead width
- **Best:** Cat-eye, aviator, semi-rimless (detail on top)
- **Avoid:** Bottom-heavy frames

## 📝 Notes & Observations

**Current Knowledge Gaps:**
- Need verification on aviator + square face compatibility
- Unclear about diamond face shape recommendations
- Material impact on face shape compatibility
- Vibe classification lacks clear criteria

**Potential Conflicts to Resolve:**
- Some sources say "face shape doesn't matter" vs others with strict rules
- Modern styling vs traditional rules
- Personal preference vs "rules"

**AZYR-Specific Considerations:**
- Vintage inventory may have different compatibility
- 1980s/90s frames might break modern "rules"
- Brand name frames vs unmarked vintage
