## 🎯 Core Styling Principle

> **"Complement, Don't Match"**
> Create CONTRAST between frame shape and face shape for balance.

- **Round faces** → Angular frames (square, rectangle, wayfarer)
- **Angular faces** → Rounded frames (round, oval, cat-eye)
- **Oval faces** → Everything works (balanced proportions)
