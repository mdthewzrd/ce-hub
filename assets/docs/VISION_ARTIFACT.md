- All workflows begin with Archon synchronization
- RAG replaces memory-based approaches
- Knowledge graph integrity drives all operations

#### 3. Plan-Mode Precedence
- Plan Mode always precedes execution
- Comprehensive planning prevents costly iterations
- User approval required before significant operations
- Systematic approach ensures quality and alignment

#### 4. Self-Improving Development
- Every completed task increases system intelligence
- Closed learning loops enable continuous enhancement
- Pattern recognition drives template creation
- System evolves through accumulated experience

#### 5. Digital Team Coordination
- Specialized sub-agents optimize workflow efficiency
- Clear handoff patterns maintain context integrity
- Parallel execution maximizes throughput
- Quality gates ensure consistent output standards
