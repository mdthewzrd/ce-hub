## 🔑 Key Insights Across All Research

### The Top 10 Insights

1. **Simplicity Wins** - Start with simplest solution, add complexity only when validated
2. **Context is Finite** - Treat every token as precious, use RAG strategically
3. **Flow State Matters** - 45-90 minute sessions with minimal interruptions
4. **Session Rituals** - 15-min prep dramatically improves flow entry
5. **Prompt Templates** - 60-80% reduction in rework when using templates
6. **Observability First** - Add monitoring from day one (Langfuse/Langsmith)
7. **Tools Before Agents** - Build and test tools independently
8. **Decision Fatigue** - ~35 decisions/day before quality degrades
9. **Progress Visibility** - Small wins create momentum
10. **Knowledge Capture** - Every session should build on the last

### The Golden Rules

> **Rule #1:** "Make it easy to do the right thing" - Atlas should make systematic building feel easier than freestyling

> **Rule #2:** "Start simple, iterate fast" - Fail with Haiku, ship with Sonnet

> **Rule #3:** "Context before action" - Always provide relevant context before asking

> **Rule #4:** "Evaluate from day one" - Test with small samples immediately

> **Rule #5:** "Capture everything" - Systematic knowledge capture compounds intelligence
