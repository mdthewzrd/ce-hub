## CRITICAL THINKING RESOURCES

**While exploring these topics, remember:**

**Skeptical Resources** (for balance):
- Committee for Skeptical Inquiry
- Skeptical Inquirer magazine
- Debunking websites (verify their claims too!)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Replicability - Can others reproduce results?
2. Falsifiability - Can the theory be tested?
3. Coherence - Does it fit with known principles?
4. Parsimony - Simplest explanation preferred
5. Evidence - What supports the claims?

**Red Flags:**
- Extraordinary claims without evidence
- Requests for large sums of money
- Secret knowledge "only I have"
- Attacks on mainstream science without substance
- Conspiracy framing without verification

**Green Flags:**
- Open sharing of information
- Encouragement of independent verification
- Integration with existing knowledge
- Humility about what's known
- Willingness to be wrong
