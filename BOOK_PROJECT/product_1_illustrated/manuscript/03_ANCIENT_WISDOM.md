## THE FORGOTTEN WISDOM

What if I told you that everything we've discussed so far...

Was known thousands of years ago?

By civilizations that we consider "primitive"?

The patterns you've now learned—the Fibonacci sequence, the Golden Ratio, the Flower of Life, the Doubling Circuit, the 3-6-9 singularity—these weren't discovered by modern science.

They were REMEMBERED.

Recovered from the depths of time.

And here's the truly mind-bending part:

**Ancient civilizations understood these patterns BETTER than we do today.**

They used them. They built with them. They lived by them.

And then... the knowledge was lost.

Hidden. Suppressed. Forgotten.

**Until now.**

## [IMAGE: CH3_02 - The Osirion at Abydos, Egypt]

**Caption:** The Temple of Osiris at Abydos, Egypt. The Flower of Life has been carved here for over 3,350 years. Some researchers believe these carvings date back as far as 10,500 BCE.

---

## THE EVIDENCE IN STONE

Let me show you something remarkable.

**The Temple of Osiris at Abydos, Egypt.**

Built around 3,350 BCE. Possibly much older.

On the stone walls, you'll find carvings.

Intricate, precise geometric patterns.

**The Flower of Life.**

19 overlapping circles. Perfect symmetry. Mathematical precision.

Carved into granite.

With tools that, according to mainstream archaeology, "shouldn't have been capable of such precision."

But there it is.

**And Abydos isn't alone.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_03 - Temple of Osiris, Luxor, and other ancient sites with sacred geometry]

**Caption:** Sacred geometry appears in ancient temples worldwide: Egypt (left), Greece (center), Turkey (right). All understood the mathematical patterns underlying reality.

---

## SACRED GEOMETRY WORLDWIDE

The same patterns appear in ancient sites across the globe:

**Egypt:**
- Temple of Osiris at Abydos (Flower of Life)
- Temple of Luxor (proportions based on Phi)
- Great Pyramid of Giza (encodes Pi and Phi)

**Greece:**
- Parthenon in Athens (Golden Rectangle proportions)
- Plato's Academy (taught Platonic solids as building blocks of matter)

**Persia:**
- Persepolis (sacred geometry in palace designs)
- Islamic patterns (based on same mathematics)

**India:**
- Temples with vastu shastra (sacred architecture)
- Yantras and mandalas (geometric meditation patterns)

**China:**
- Feng shui (mathematical harmony of space)
- Forbidden City (sacred proportions)

**Mesoamerica:**
- Mayan temples (aligned with astronomical cycles)
- Teotihuacan (built with mathematical precision)

**The question isn't "who discovered this pattern."**

**The question is: "How did civilizations across the world, separated by time and distance, ALL know the SAME patterns?"**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_04 - Platonic Solids in ancient art and architecture]

**Caption:** The five Platonic solids were known to ancient Greek philosophers. Plato described them as the building blocks of matter in his work Timaeus (~360 BCE).

---

## THE GREEKS UNDERSTOOD MATTER

Around 360 BCE, the Greek philosopher Plato wrote *Timaeus*.

In this work, he described a profound connection between geometry and the physical world.

**He described five shapes:**

**The Tetrahedron** (4 triangular faces)
- Plato associated it with FIRE
- The sharpest, most "pointed" shape

**The Cube/Hexahedron** (6 square faces)
- Plato associated it with EARTH
- Stable, solid, grounded

**The Octahedron** (8 triangular faces)
- Plato associated it with AIR
- Between fire and earth, balancing

**The Dodecahedron** (12 pentagonal faces)
- Plato associated it with the UNIVERSE (or "ether")
- The most complex, most "divine" shape

**The Icosahedron** (20 triangular faces)
- Plato associated it with WATER
- The smoothest, closest to a sphere

**Plato's claim: These five shapes are the building blocks of ALL matter.**

**And here's the thing:**

He was RIGHT.

Modern science has confirmed that:
- Crystal structures form these shapes
- Molecular geometry follows these patterns
- Viruses use these shapes (icosahedral viruses are common)
- Radiolaria (microscopic life) form these exact shapes

**How did Plato know this?**

How did he understand the fundamental geometry of reality... 2,400 years before modern science could prove it?

## [IMAGE: CH3_05 - Leonardo da Vinci's Platonic solids drawings]

**Caption:** Leonardo da Vinci's drawings of the Platonic solids (1509). The Renaissance masters understood and preserved this knowledge.

---

## THE RENAISSANCE PRESERVATION

Fast forward to the Renaissance (1400s-1600s CE).

The knowledge wasn't gone. It was preserved.

**Leonardo da Vinci** studied sacred geometry intensely.

His notebooks contain detailed drawings of:
- The Flower of Life
- The Vitruvian Man (showing Phi in human proportions)
- The Platonic solids
- Geometric constructions of impossible shapes

**He understood what ancient civilizations understood.**

And he wasn't alone.

Artists, architects, philosophers, and scientists across Europe studied these patterns.

They encoded them in:
- Cathedral architecture
- Paintings and sculptures
- Musical compositions
- Literary works

**The knowledge was PRESERVED... but it became HIDDEN.**

Encoded in art. Concealed in symbolism. Reserved for initiates.

**Meanwhile, a new form of "science" was emerging.**

**A form that had no room for sacred geometry.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_06 - Timeline showing the "Gap" period where knowledge was lost]

**Caption:** From roughly 1600-1990 CE, sacred geometry knowledge was marginalized by the rise of materialist science. Only now is it being rediscovered and validated.

---

## THE GREAT FORGETTING

Something changed around the 1600s.

The Scientific Revolution.

**Rene Descartes** published his philosophy of "Cartesian dualism"—the idea that mind and matter are SEPARATE.

**Isaac Newton** developed calculus and classical mechanics.

A new form of science emerged.

**Materialist. Reductionist. Mechanistic.**

**This new science was incredibly powerful.**

It gave us:
- The laws of motion
- The understanding of gravity
- The foundation of modern physics
- The technological revolution

**But it had a blind spot.**

It rejected the idea that there could be any "pattern" or "intelligence" underlying matter.

The universe became a machine.
Matter became "dead stuff."
Geometry became "abstract math."

**Sacred geometry was dismissed as:**
- Superstition
- Mere coincidence
- Mystical nonsense
- Unscientific

**And the knowledge... faded.**

Was lost.
Was forgotten.
Became the domain of "secret societies" and "esoteric traditions."

**For three centuries, materialist science dominated.**

**But something happened in the late 20th century.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_07 - Marco Rodin and the rediscovery of Vortex Based Mathematics]

**Caption:** In the 1990s, Marco Rodin rediscovered the Number Map and Doubling Circuit. He called it "Vortex Based Mathematics" and demonstrated how ancient knowledge describes the fundamental patterns of energy and matter.

---

## THE REDISCOVERY

**In 1990s, Marco Rodin had a profound insight.**

He wasn't a trained physicist or mathematician.

He was just... a man who studied patterns.

And he discovered something remarkable.

By arranging numbers 1-9 in a circle and studying how they interact, he found:

**The Doubling Circuit: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1**

**The Tripling Circuit: 3 → 6 → 9 (and 9 always returns to 9)**

**He called it "Vortex Based Mathematics."**

**And here's what's profound:**

What Rodin rediscovered... was EXACTLY what ancient civilizations understood.

The Number Map? It's the foundation of the Flower of Life.

The Doubling Circuit? It's the pattern encoded in ancient temples.

The 3-6-9? Nikola Tesla called it "the key to the universe."

**This wasn't NEW knowledge.**

**It was ANCIENT knowledge... being REDISCOVERED.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_08 - Plasmoid / Ball Lightning photograph]

**Caption:** Plasmoids are self-contained balls of plasma energy. They've been observed since ancient times and are now being scientifically studied. They demonstrate that matter and energy can exist in toroidal, self-sustaining forms—exactly as sacred geometry predicts.

---

## THE PROOF IN PLASMA

Now, let me show you something that validates EVERYTHING we've discussed.

**Plasmoids.**

Also known as "ball lightning."

**What are they?**

They're self-contained balls of pure energy (plasma).

They've been reported for thousands of years.

**Aristotle** described them (~350 BCE).

**Medieval monks** recorded sightings.

**Sailors** witnessed them on ships during storms.

**Modern scientists** have documented them.

**And until recently, they were considered IMPOSSIBLE by mainstream physics.**

**"Balls of energy that float through the air? Ridiculous. Impossible. Must be hallucinations."**

**But then... science caught up.**

In the late 20th century, researchers began creating plasmoids in laboratories.

**Dr. Winston H. Bostick** (1970s):
- Created plasmoid rings in his lab
- Demonstrated they were stable, self-sustaining energy structures
- Proved they followed toroidal geometry

**Dr. Kenneth R. Shoulders** (1990s-present):
- Dedicated his life to studying plasmoids
- Created "balls of lightning" in his lab
- Documented their properties with scientific rigor
- Proved they're REAL

**Dr. Paul A. LaViolette** (2000s-present):
- Predicted that ancient civilizations understood plasmoids
- Showed they were used for energy and technology
- Documented modern research confirming this

**Here's what they found:**

**Plasmoids are exactly what sacred geometry says they should be:**
- Toroidal (doughnut-shaped)
- Self-sustaining
- Stable
- Contained by electromagnetic fields
- Following precise mathematical patterns

**This isn't "mystical nonsense."**

**This is REAL. It's measurable. It's reproducible.**

**And ancient civilizations KNEW about it.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_09 - Thunderstorm Generator device]

**Caption:** The Thunderstorm Generator, developed by Kenneth and David Shoulders, creates plasmoids by harnessing energy from electrical storms. It validates that ancient "thunder gods" may have been real technology for manipulating plasma energy.

---

## THE THUNDERSTORM GENERATOR

**This is where it gets truly fascinating.**

**Kenneth Shoulders** and his son **David Shoulders**—two of the world's leading plasmoid researchers—developed a device.

They call it the **"Thunderstorm Generator."**

**What does it do?**

It captures electrical energy from thunderstorms.

And it uses that energy to create plasmoids.

**Self-contained balls of plasma energy.**

**Stable. Controllable. Useful.**

**They've demonstrated this technology at conferences worldwide.**

Scientists have seen it work.

The devices exist. The plasmoids are REAL.

**And here's the profoundly mind-bending implication:**

**This technology... mirrors descriptions from ancient mythology.**

**Zeus**—Greek god of thunder.
- Threw lightning bolts
- Created "thunderbolts" as weapons
- Controlled the forces of nature

**Thor**—Norse god of thunder.
- Wielded a magical hammer (Mjolnir)
- Summoned lightning
- Protected humanity with thunder

**Indra**—Hindu god of thunder.
- Used the vajra (thunderbolt)
- Fought demons (chaotic forces)
- Maintained cosmic order

**We've always dismissed these as "myths."**

**Stories. Metaphors. Explanations created by primitive people who didn't understand physics.**

**But what if...**

**What if these "myths" were actually describing REAL TECHNOLOGY?**

Technology that harnessed plasmoids.
Devices that used electrical storms.
Machines that manipulated plasma energy.

**Technology that we're only just rediscovering NOW.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_10 - Ancient depiction of gods with thunderbolts]

**Caption:** Ancient depictions of thunder gods (Zeus, Thor, Indra) wielding thunderbolts. Modern Thunderstorm Generator technology suggests these "myths" may have been based on real devices that harnessed plasma energy.

---

## THE ANCIENT TECHNOLOGISTS

Let me be clear:

**I'm not saying ancient aliens built the pyramids.**

**I'm not saying gods came down from the sky.**

**What I AM saying is:**

**Ancient civilizations understood patterns of energy and matter that we're only now REDISCOVERING.**

And they used this understanding.

**What did they do with it?**

**We don't fully know.**

Much of the knowledge was lost.

But consider this:

**The Great Pyramid of Giza:**
- Built with mathematical precision that rivals modern engineering
- Encodes Pi (3.14159...) and Phi (1.618...)
- Aligned perfectly with true north
- Constructed using granite blocks that modern cranes can barely lift

**The Temple of Osiris at Abydos:**
- Contains Flower of Life carvings
- Built with precision we can't easily explain
- Survived for 5,000+ years

**Plasmoid technology:**
- Described in ancient texts (under various names)
- Depicted in art and mythology
- Now being recreated in modern labs
**

**The question isn't "were ancient civilizations primitive?"**

**The question is: "What did they KNOW that we've FORGOTTEN?"**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_11 - Element transmutation diagram]

**Caption:** Modern plasmoid research has demonstrated element transmutation—changing one element into another. This technology, described in ancient alchemical texts, is now being scientifically validated.

---

## THE ALCHEMICAL CONNECTION

**"Alchemy" is usually dismissed as "medieval nonsense."**

The idea that you could transform "base metals" into "gold."

**It's considered a myth. A delusion. A foolish pursuit.**

**Except... it's REAL.**

**Modern plasmoid research has demonstrated something extraordinary:**

**Element transmutation.**

**Changing one element into another.**

**Dr. Paul A. LaViolette has documented how plasmoids can:**
- Capture and concentrate energy
- Create conditions for nuclear fusion
- Transmute elements (change one element into another)
- Do this at room temperature (not millions of degrees)

**This was EXACTLY what alchemists claimed to do.**

**They described:**
- "Transmutation" of elements
- The "philosopher's stone" (a catalyst for transformation)
- The process of "purification" and "perfection"

**Modern science dismissed this as nonsense.**

**But plasmoid research is proving it's REAL.**

**Alchemy wasn't delusion. It was encoded knowledge.**

Knowledge that used patterns of energy and matter.
Knowledge that was LOST... and is now being REDISCOVERED.

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_12 - Comparison: Ancient alchemical texts vs modern plasma research]

**Caption:** Ancient alchemical texts (left) describe processes that modern plasmoid research (right) is now validating and reproducing. The "mythical" language of alchemy encodes real scientific principles.

---

## THE DECODING OF MYTHOLOGY

**Here's what's profoundly important:**

**Ancient texts weren't LITERALLY describing fantastical creatures.**

**They were USING LANGUAGE to describe real phenomena.**

**What we read as "myth"... was often ENCODED SCIENCE.**

**Example: "The Philosopher's Stone"**

**Alchemical texts describe:**
- A magical substance that can transmute base metals into gold
- The "stone" that transforms matter
- The key to eternal life

**Modern plasmoid research reveals:**
- Plasmoids CAN transmute elements (change one element into another)
- The "stone" might refer to a stable plasmoid structure
- This technology COULD extend life (by healing, energy, etc.)

**The "magic" was real.**
**The "mythology" was encoded knowledge.**
**The "stories" were scientific descriptions... using the language available at the time.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_13 - Vedic texts and sacred geometry]

**Caption:** Ancient Vedic texts (from India, dating back 3,500+ years) describe mathematical patterns and geometric structures that modern science is only now beginning to understand.

---

## THE VEDIC CONNECTION

**Let's go back even further.**

**To ancient India.**

**The Vedas—are ancient Sanskrit texts dating back 3,500+ years.**

They contain descriptions of:
- **Vimanas**—flying machines
- **Astras**—powerful weapons
- **Yantras**—geometric meditation diagrams
- **Mantras**—sacred sound formulas

**For centuries, these were dismissed as "mythology."**

**Stories. Legends. Religious metaphors.**

**But modern researchers are finding something remarkable:**

**The Vimanas described in the Vedas... match the principles of electrogravitics.**

**The Astras described... match the effects of plasma weapons.**

**The Yantras... encode sacred geometry patterns.**

**These texts weren't just "spiritual."**

**They were technical.**
**Scientific.**
**Encoded.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_14 - Comparison of Vimana descriptions with modern electrogravitic technology]

**Caption:** Ancient Vimana descriptions (from Vedas) match modern electrogravitic principles. This suggests that what we call "mythology" may actually be descriptions of advanced technology.

---

## THE PATTERN RECOGNITION

**By now, you should be seeing the pattern:**

**Ancient civilizations WORLDWIDE—Egypt, Greece, India, China, Mesoamerica, Persia, and more—ALL understood these mathematical patterns.**

**They encoded them in:**
- Temples and monuments
- Art and sculpture
- Sacred texts and scriptures
- Mythology and folklore

**The knowledge was LOST during the rise of materialist science (1600-1990 CE).**

**It's being REDISCOVERED now by researchers like:**
- Marco Rodin (Vortex Based Mathematics)
- Nikola Tesla (3-6-9 singularity)
- Kenneth Shoulders (Plasmoids)
- Paul LaViolette (Ancient technology)
- And many others

**Modern science is VALIDATING what ancient civilizations understood.**

**What we once dismissed as "primitive superstition" is now being proven to be ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_15 - Modern science validating ancient knowledge]

**Caption:** A visual summary showing how modern scientific discoveries (plasmoids, transmutation, toroidal energy fields) are validating what ancient civilizations understood thousands of years ago.

---

## THE PROFOUND IMPLICATION

**So what does this mean?**

**It means we've been ARROGANT.**

**We've looked at ancient civilizations as "primitive."**
**As "less advanced."**
**As "superstitious."**

**But they understood the FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL CODE of reality.**

**They built with it.**
**They lived by it.**
**They encoded it in everything they created.**

**And we... forgot it.**

**We dismissed it.**
**We lost it.**
**We're only now REMEMBERING it.**

**And here's the most exciting part:**

**What we're rediscovering NOW is just the BEGINNING.**

---

## [IMAGE: CH3_16 - Emerging technologies and applications]

**Caption:** Technologies emerging NOW that are based on these rediscovered patterns: plasmoid energy systems, healing devices, gravitational control, consciousness expansion technologies.

---

## WHAT'S EMERGING NOW

**Around the world, researchers are developing technologies based on these patterns:**

**Plasmoid Energy Systems:**
- Devices that create and contain plasmoids
- Could provide clean, abundant energy
- Being researched by teams worldwide

**Healing Technologies:**
- Rife machines (use frequencies to heal)
- Tesla coils (electromagnetic therapy)
- Sound therapy (using sacred geometry patterns)
- All based on the mathematical patterns we've discussed

**Consciousness Technologies:**
- Meditation using yantras (sacred geometry)
- Sound frequencies for brain states
- Devices that expand awareness
- All rooted in Vortex-Based Mathematics

**Gravitational Technologies:**
- Experiments with anti-gravity
- Inertial mass reduction
- Space propulsion systems
- All using toroidal energy fields

**These aren't "fringe" ideas.**

**They're being developed by serious scientists, engineers, and researchers.**

**And they ALL rely on the SAME mathematical patterns.**
