## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a DRAMATIC moment in the chapter. Design should feel like revealing a secret.**

**The Mathematical Fact:**
- 3 × 3 = 9
- 9 × 3 = 27 → 2+7 = 9
- 27 × 3 = 81 → 8+1 = 9
- Tripling ALWAYS returns to 9
- 9 is a singularity - a point of perfect balance

**Triangle Design:**
- Equilateral triangle connecting 3-6-9
- 9 at top (apex), 3 at bottom right, 6 at bottom left
- Or: 3 at top left, 6 at top right, 9 at bottom center
- Both orientations work - choose what looks best

**Visual Impact:**
- Dark background makes gold really pop
- This should feel like a "reveal" or "secret knowledge"
- Consider adding subtle glow/halo effect around the triangle

**Tesla Quote Placement:**
- Can be at bottom, or overlaid faintly in background
- Use semi-transparent dark box behind text for readability
- Attribution: "— Nikola Tesla" in smaller font

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Tesla understood this, ancient cultures did too
- **Modern precision:** Mathematical accuracy
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real quote, real math

**Teaching Point:**
The 3-6-9 represents the "vertical" axis - the singularity around which the Doubling Circuit spins.
