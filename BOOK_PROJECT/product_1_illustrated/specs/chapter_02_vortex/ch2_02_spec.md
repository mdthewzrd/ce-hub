## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### File Formats
- **SVG:** ch2_02_doubling_circuit.svg
- **PNG:** ch2_02_doubling_circuit.png (300 DPI)

### Quality Check
- [ ] Doubling circuit numbers (1,2,4,8,7,5) are emphasized
- [ ] Non-circuit numbers (3,6,9) are muted
- [ ] Arrows clearly show directional flow
- [ ] Path is accurate: 1→2→4→8→7→5→1
- [ ] Arrow gradient effect is subtle but visible
- [ ] Typography is consistent and readable
- [ ] Educational value is clear (teaches the concept)

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a KEY teaching diagram - must be crystal clear.**

**The Mathematical Pattern:**
- 1 × 2 = 2
- 2 × 2 = 4
- 4 × 2 = 8
- 8 × 2 = 16 → 1+6 = 7
- 16 × 2 = 32 → 3+2 = 5
- 32 × 2 = 64 → 6+4 = 10 → 1+0 = 1

**Arrow Design:**
- Curved arrows following the circle's curvature
- Gradient from Deep Blue to Violet (#7b1fa2)
- Arrowheads showing direction clearly
- 3px line weight for visibility

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Circuit numbers: Full color, prominent
- Non-circuit numbers: Gray, smaller, muted
- This teaches which numbers are IN the circuit

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small multiplication symbols (×2) along the arrows to remind readers of the pattern.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Sacred numerology understood this
- **Modern precision:** Mathematical accuracy
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real math, not magic

**Layout Note:**
This will be referenced multiple times throughout the chapter. Make it clear and reproducible.

## AI AGENT PROMPT

```
Please create a Doubling Circuit diagram on the Number Map.

Requirements:
- Start with Number Map: circle with numbers 1-9 evenly spaced
- Highlight numbers in Doubling Circuit: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5 in Deep Blue (#1a237e)
- Mute numbers NOT in circuit: 3, 6, 9 in gray (#9e9e9e)
- Add curved arrows showing flow: 1→2→4→8→7→5→1
- Arrows: Blue to violet gradient (#1a237e → #7b1fa2), 3px weight
- Arrowheads clearly showing direction
- Background: Light parchment (#faf5e6)
- Numbers: Space Mono, 36pt (circuit) or 28pt (non-circuit)
- Main label: "The Doubling Circuit: 1→2→4→8→7→5→1" (Cinzel, 16pt, Deep Blue)
- Note: "The pattern of expansion in nature" (Inter Italic, 11pt, gray)
- Make the circuit pattern visually obvious
- Educational clarity is priority
