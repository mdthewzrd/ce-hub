- 40° between each number
- Perfect circle, geometric precision
- Large, prominent numbers

**Teaching Annotations:**

**1. Construction Steps (small inset)**

- Foundation for all patterns

**3. Key Numbers Highlighted**
- Doubling Circuit: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5 (blue circles around them)
- Tripling Circuit: 3, 6, 9 (gold circles around them)
- Shows they're separate but related

**4. Mathematical Facts**
- 9 = completion (1+9=10→1+0=1, cycle repeats)
- 3, 6, 9 = multiples of 3 (tripling pattern)
- 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5 = doubling pattern
- All numbers connect through patterns

**5. Direction Indicators**
- Clockwise arrow (optional)
- Shows direction of counting
- Small curved arrow in violet

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is the COMPREHENSIVE teaching diagram for the Number Map.**

**Difference from CH2_01:**
- CH2_01: Simple introduction, clean
- CH2_11: Detailed teaching, annotated
- CH2_01 shows WHAT, CH2_11 shows HOW and WHY

**Teaching Approach:**
1. Start with construction (how to build it)
2. Show the properties (what it does)
3. Reveal the patterns (Doubling, Tripling)
4. Explain the mathematics (why it works)
5. Connect to larger concepts (universe)

**Key Properties to Teach:**

**Modular Arithmetic:**
- We're using "mod 9" arithmetic
- Any number reduced to 1 digit
- Example: 25 → 2+5=7
- Example: 18 → 1+8=9
- Creates circular system

**The Number 9:**
- 9 is special (completion)
- 9+1=10→1+0=1 (cycle restarts)
- 9×anything = multiple of 9 → sums to 9
- 9 is a singularity (point of balance)

**The Two Circuits:**
- Doubling: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5 (expansion)
- Tripling: 3, 6, 9 (singularity)
- Separate but related
- Both emerge from Number Map

**Why This Foundation:**
The Number Map is the STARTING POINT. Everything else (Doubling Circuit, Tripling Circuit, ABHA Torus) comes from this simple arrangement.

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Keep main Number Map large and clean
- Use callout boxes for annotations
- Color-code: Blue for doubling, Gold for tripling
- Don't overcrowd - leave space for clarity
- Make it feel like a TEACHING TOOL

**Educational Value:**
This diagram should allow someone to:
- Understand how to construct Number Map
- See the mathematical properties
- Recognize the two circuits
- Grasp why this is foundational
- Be ready for more complex concepts

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Simple but profound
- **Modern precision:** Mathematical accuracy
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real math, real patterns
