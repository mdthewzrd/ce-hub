## SPECIAL NOTES

**This provides DETAILED examples of the torus pattern.**

**Difference from CH2_07:**
- CH2_07: Shows many examples across scales
- CH2_16: Shows fewer examples in more detail
- CH2_07 is breadth, CH2_16 is depth

**The Teaching Approach:**
For each example:
1. Show the torus shape clearly
2. Explain HOW the Doubling Circuit creates it
3. Note why torus is the natural form
4. Connect to the mathematical pattern

**Key Insights to Convey:**

**Magnetic Fields:**
- Generated by rotating/spinning systems
- Rotation creates Doubling Circuit pattern
- Circuit wrapped in 3D = torus
- This is why ALL magnetic fields are toroidal

**Hurricanes:**
- Heat energy flows in (top)
- Spirals due to Coriolis effect (Doubling Circuit)
- Flows through eye (center, 3-6-9 axis)
- Exits top (updraft)
- Perfect torus flow

**Smoke Rings:**
- Ring vortex is self-stabilizing
- Torus shape minimizes energy loss
- Maintains coherence longer
- Proof that torus = stability

**Atoms:**
- Electrons don't orbit like planets
- They form probability clouds
- Clouds are toroidal (doughnut) shaped
- Quantum mechanics confirms this
- Tesla intuited this 100+ years ago

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Use 4 examples that are DISTINCTLY different
- Scale from microscopic (atom) to planetary (magnetic field)
- Use real photos where possible
- Torus overlay should be UNMISTAKABLE
- Connect each to Doubling Circuit concept

**Teaching Point:**
The torus shape in nature isn't random - it's the INEVITABLE result of energy flowing through the Doubling Circuit pattern. The mathematics CREATES the physical shape.
