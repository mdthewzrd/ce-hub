**Mathematical Proofs (surrounding):**

**Proof 1: 3 × 3 = 9**
```
3 × 3 = 9
Single digit: 9
Result: 9 (singularity)
```

**Proof 2: 9 × 3 = 9**
```
9 × 3 = 27
Sum digits: 2 + 7 = 9
Result: 9 (always returns to 9)
```

**Proof 3: 27 × 3 = 9**
```
27 × 3 = 81
Sum digits: 8 + 1 = 9
Result: 9 (always returns to 9)
```

**Proof 4: 81 × 3 = 9**
```
81 × 3 = 243
Sum digits: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9
Result: 9 (always returns to 9)
```

**Proof 5: 243 × 3 = 9**
```
243 × 3 = 729
Sum digits: 7 + 2 + 9 = 18
Sum again: 1 + 8 = 9
Result: 9 (always returns to 9)
```

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is the DRAMATIC REVELATION of Chapter 2 - Tesla's "key to the universe."**

**Difference from CH2_03:**
- CH2_03: Shows 3-6-9 triangle visually
- CH2_13: Proves it mathematically + Tesla connection
- CH2_03 is "what it looks like", CH2_13 is "what it MEANS"

**The Profound Realization:**
When you triple ANY number, you eventually reach 9.
And once you're at 9, you STAY at 9 (9×3=27→2+7=9).

9 is a SINGULARITY.
A point of perfect balance.
The axis around which everything else spins.

**Mathematical Proof:**
```
3 × 3 = 9
9 × 3 = 27 → 2+7 = 9
27 × 3 = 81 → 8+1 = 9
81 × 3 = 243 → 2+4+3 = 9
243 × 3 = 729 → 7+2+9 = 18 → 1+8 = 9
...
Infinity: Always 9
```

**Why This Matters:**
- The Doubling Circuit (1→2→4→8→7→5) spins AROUND the 3-6-9
- 3-6-9 is the AXIS
- 9 is the SINGULARITY (center point)
- This explains energy flow, torus shape, everything
- Tesla understood this as "key to the universe"

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Dark background = dramatic, space, mystery
- Gold triangle = illumination, revelation, sacred
- Glow effect = energy, power, importance
- Tesla quote = validation from genius
- Make it feel like REVEALING A SECRET

**Teaching Point:**
The 3-6-9 isn't just another pattern - it's THE CENTRAL AXIS. The Doubling Circuit spins around it. The ABHA Torus has it as the central column. Everything else revolves around 3-6-9.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Tesla and ancient cultures understood this
- **Modern precision:** Mathematical proof, undeniable
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real math, real quote, real genius

**Connection to Earlier Content:**
- Chapter 1 showed torus SHAPE
- Chapter 2 shows Doubling CIRCUIT
- This shows the CENTRAL AXIS (3-6-9)
- Next: How it all creates ABHA Torus

**Dramatic Impact:**
This should be a "wow" moment in the chapter. The realization that 9 is a singularity, that Tesla knew this, that it's mathematically provable - this is PROFOUND.
