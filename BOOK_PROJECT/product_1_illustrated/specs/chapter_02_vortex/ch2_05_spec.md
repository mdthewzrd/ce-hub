## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style

### Elements to Include
1. **3D torus shape** - Doughnut form, angled view
2. **Doubling Circuit path** - Spiraling around torus surface
   - Shows 1→2→4→8→7→5→1 progression
   - Numbered markers along path
   - Curved arrows showing direction
3. **Energy flow indicators** - Animated look (even if static)
4. **Multiple views** - Show from different angles:
   - Main view: Angled, shows circuit clearly
   - Top view: Shows circuit spiral from above
   - Side view: Shows vertical flow
5. **Central axis** - Dashed violet line through center
6. **Entry/exit points** - Show energy in (top) and out (bottom)

### Doubling Circuit on Torus

**The Circuit Wraps Around:**
- Starts at top (1)
- Spirals down outside (1→2→4→8)
- Crosses to inside (8→7)
- Spirals up inside (7→5→1)
- Completes loop at top
- Creates continuous energy flow

**Visualization:**
- Outside spiral: Descending (expansion)
- Inside spiral: Ascending (contraction)
- Balance of outward and inward flow

## SPECIAL NOTES

**The ABHA Torus is the 3D MANIFESTATION of the Doubling Circuit.**

**What is the ABHA Torus:**
- Torus (doughnut) shape
- Doubling Circuit wrapped around surface
- Creates complete energy flow system
- Shows how 2D circuit becomes 3D reality
- Mathematical model of energy flow

**Energy Flow Pattern:**
1. **Entry**: Energy enters along central axis (top)
2. **Descent**: Flows down outside (1→2→4→8)
   - This is EXPANSION phase
3. **Transition**: Crosses from outside to inside (8→7)
4. **Ascent**: Flows up through center (7→5→1)
   - This is CONTRACTION phase
5. **Exit**: Completes loop, ready for next cycle
6. **Continuous**: Self-sustaining flow

**Why It Matters:**
- Explains WHY torus shape appears in nature
- Shows mathematical basis for energy flow
- Connects 2D Number Map to 3D reality
- Demonstrates balance of expansion/contraction
- Provides model for understanding energy systems

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Use 3D rendering or precise technical drawing
- Show circuit as GOLD line on torus surface
- Number markers should be visible and accurate
- Add arrows showing flow direction
- Use multiple angles to clarify 3D structure
- Add subtle glow to suggest energy movement

**Multiple Views to Include:**
1. **Main angled view** - Shows overall structure
2. **Top-down view** - Shows spiral pattern clearly
3. **Side view** - Shows vertical flow and symmetry
4. **Cutaway view** (optional) - Shows interior circuit path

**Teaching Point:**
The Doubling Circuit isn't just a flat circle - when wrapped in 3D space, it creates a torus. THIS is why energy flows in toroidal patterns everywhere in nature.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Many cultures depicted torus energy
- **Modern precision:** Mathematically accurate 3D model
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real geometry, not magic

**Connection to Chapter 1:**
- Chapter 1 showed torus SHAPE
- Chapter 2 explains torus MECHANISM (Doubling Circuit)
- This connects the pattern to the shape

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small callout: "The ABHA Torus explains smoke rings, magnetic fields, atoms, and galaxies - all the same pattern."

**Technical Note:**
The ABHA Torus was developed by Marko Rodin as part of Vortex Based Mathematics. It's considered the mathematical model of how energy creates matter.
