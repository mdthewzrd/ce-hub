## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is the REFERENCE SHEET for Chapter 2 - comprehensive summary.**

**Purpose:**
- Quick reference for Chapter 2 concepts
- Study guide for review
- Visual summary of main points
- Shows relationships between concepts
- Reinforces learning

**Design Strategy:**
- Clean, organized layout
- Consistent styling throughout
- Visual icons for each concept
- Minimal text, maximum information
- Color-coded for easy reference

**Content Flow:**
1. **Foundation** → Number Map (where it starts)
2. **First Circuit** → Doubling (expansion pattern)
3. **Second Circuit** → 3-6-9 (singularity/axis)
4. **3D Result** → ABHA Torus (shape created)
5. **Validation** → Tesla (historical confirmation)
6. **Application** → Rodin Coils (practical use)

This tells the COMPLETE STORY of Chapter 2 in one image.

**Typography Hierarchy:**
1. Title (largest, 24pt, Cinzel SemiBold)
2. Section headers (14pt, Cinzel Regular)
3. Body text (10pt, Inter Regular)
4. Footer/captions (9pt, Inter Italic)

**Color Coding:**
- Number Map: Blue theme
- Doubling Circuit: Blue-violet gradient
- 3-6-9: Gold theme
