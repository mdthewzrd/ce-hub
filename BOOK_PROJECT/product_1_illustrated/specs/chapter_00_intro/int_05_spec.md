### Visual Style
- **Background:** Deep Space (#0a0e27) - makes colors pop
- **Musical Elements:** White with blue glow (#ffffff with #1a237e glow)

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This continues the RECOGNITION phase - shows pattern in something familiar (music).**

**The Mathematical Connection:**
- Octave ratio: 2:1 (first Fibonacci numbers beyond 1)
- Perfect fifth: 3:2 ratio (Fibonacci numbers)
- Musical scale: 8 notes in octave (Fibonacci number)
- 13 semitones in octave (Fibonacci number)
- Phi appears in classical compositions (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart)
- Modern songs also show phi in climaxes and structure

**Visualization Options:**
1. **Piano keyboard** with colored keys showing Fibonacci positions
2. **Musical spiral** - wrap musical scale around golden spiral
3. **Frequency bars** - harmonic series as vertical bars with phi indicators
4. **Sound waveform** - show phi-based waveform pattern
5. **Musical staff** - with notes at Fibonacci intervals

**Best Approach:**
Combine elements for clarity:
- Piano keyboard at bottom (recognizable anchor)
- Phi spiral overlaid showing harmonic relationships
- Small frequency bars showing harmonic series
- Keep it simple - don't overcrowd

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Sacred music, chants, scales understood this
- **Modern precision:** Accurate frequency ratios and mathematics
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real music theory, real math

**Educational Value:**
This shows that the pattern isn't just visual - it's AURAL too. Music resonates because of these mathematical relationships.

**Alternative Ideas:**
- Could show famous song structure with phi-climax marked
- Could compare random vs phi-based composition
- Could add small quote from musician or composer
