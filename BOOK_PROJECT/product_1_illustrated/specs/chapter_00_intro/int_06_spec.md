**Description:** Classical building facade (Parthenon or similar Greek temple) with Golden Ratio rectangles and Phi proportions overlaid to show intentional design. Should demonstrate that ancient architects encoded this knowledge.

## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Light Parchment (#faf5e6) - historical document feel
- **Building:** Dark Blue (#1a237e), 2px line weight (drawing style, not photo)
- **Phi Overlays:** Gold (#ffd700), 2px line weight, 75% opacity
- **Measurement Lines:** Violet (#7b1fa2), 1px, dashed
- **Ground Line:** Dark Blue, 3px solid

### Elements to Include
1. **Temple facade** - Classical Greek style (columns, pediment)
2. **Golden rectangles** - Multiple showing φ proportions
3. **Phi spirals** - Showing flow and composition
4. **Height to width ratio** - φ = 1.618...
5. **Column spacing** - Golden ratio relationships
6. **Pediment proportions** - Golden triangles
7. **Small text labels** - "φ = 1.618..." at key points

### Labels & Text
- **Main Label:** Cinzel Regular, 14pt, Deep Blue (#1a237e)
- **Content:** "They Knew This 2,500 Years Ago"
- **Sub-label:** Inter Italic, 11pt, gray
- **Content:** "Ancient Greek architects built with Phi"
- **Building Name:** "The Parthenon, 447 BC" (Inter Regular, 10pt, violet)
- **Phi Labels:** Small "φ = 1.618..." at key measurements (Space Mono, 9pt, gold)
- **Date:** Small date marker to show age

### Dimensions
- **Primary Use:** Historical connection, half-page
- **Size:** 1200x900px (horizontal)
- **DPI:** 300

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### File Formats
- **SVG:** int_06_architecture_phi.svg
- **PNG:** int_06_architecture_phi.png (300 DPI)

### Quality Check
- [ ] Building is recognizable as classical Greek temple
- [ ] Golden rectangles are accurately placed
- [ ] Multiple φ relationships shown (not just one)
- [ ] Drawing style is clean and consistent
- [ ] Historical feel is conveyed
- [ ] Labels are readable and don't clutter
- [ ] Demonstrates INTENTIONAL use of phi (not accidental)

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This establishes ANCIENT WISDOM - they knew this thousands of years ago.**

**Historical Context:**
- Parthenon built 447-432 BC (2,500 years ago)
- Facade fits perfectly into Golden Rectangle
- Column spacing follows phi proportions
- Pediment is golden triangle
- This was INTENTIONAL, not accidental
- Greeks understood and taught sacred geometry

**Other Examples Could Include:**
- Great Pyramid of Giza (Pi and Phi relationships)
- Notre Dame Cathedral (built with Golden Ratio)
- Taj Mahal (Islamic geometry and phi)
- Many classical buildings follow these proportions

**Why the Parthenon:**
- Most recognizable example
- Well-documented golden ratio usage
- Clean, simple facade (easy to show clearly)
- Represents peak of Greek architecture
- Familiar to most readers

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Show entire facade in golden rectangle
- Add smaller golden rectangles within
- Highlight column spacing ratios
- Show pediment triangle (golden triangle: 72°-72°-36°)
- Keep it clean - don't overcrowd

**Teaching Point:**
This wasn't just aesthetic - they understood this was FUNDAMENTAL to harmony and beauty in design.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Direct hit - they literally knew this
- **Modern precision:** Accurate measurements and geometry
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real building, real math, historical fact

**Educational Value:**
Proves this knowledge has been LOST and is being REDISCOVERED. Sets up later chapters about why it was hidden.
