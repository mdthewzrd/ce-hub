## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Light Parchment (#faf5e6) - classic feel
- **Figure:** Dark Blue (#1a237e), 2px line weight, clean drawing style
- **Phi Overlays:** Gold (#ffd700), 1.5px line weight
- **Measurement Lines:** Violet (#7b1fa2), 1px, dashed
- **Opacity:** 80% for overlays (allow base drawing to show)

### Elements to Include
1. **Human figure** - Standing, arms outstretched (Vitruvian pose)
2. **Phi markers** - Golden ratio rectangles showing body proportions
3. **Navel to floor** vs **Navel to top of head** ratio
4. **Arm segments** - Shoulder to elbow vs elbow to fingertip
5. **Finger proportions** - Individual phalanx ratios
6. **Face proportions** - Golden rectangle overlay
7. **Phi symbols** - Small φ symbols with "1.618..." labels

### Labels & Text
- **Main Label:** Cinzel Regular, 14pt, Deep Blue (#1a237e)
- **Content:** "Your Body is Built on Phi"
- **Phi Symbols:** Gold circles with φ, Space Mono, 12pt
- **Measurements:** Small measurement lines with ratios, Inter, 10pt, violet
- **Key Insight:** "The Golden Ratio is encoded in YOU" (Inter Italic, 11pt, gold)

### Dimensions
- **Primary Use:** Personal connection moment, half-page
- **Size:** 1000x1400px (vertical, portrait)
- **DPI:** 300

### Quality Check
- [ ] Human figure is anatomically proportional
- [ ] Phi rectangles are accurate (φ = 1.618...)
- [ ] Multiple body proportions shown (not just one)
- [ ] Lines are clean and precise
- [ ] Labels are readable and educational
- [ ] Creates personal connection (reader sees themselves)
- [ ] Gold color pops against parchment background

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a PERSONAL CONNECTION moment - reader sees the pattern in themselves.**

**The Mathematical Facts:**
- Navel divides height: 1.618... ratio (top to navel : navel to feet)
- Arm proportions: Shoulder to elbow : elbow to fingertip = 1.618...
- Finger segments: Multiple φ ratios in each finger
- Face: Width to height, eye spacing, nose proportions - all φ
- DNA helix: Major groove to minor groove = φ (could add small detail)

**Drawing Style:**
- Clean, technical drawing style (like Vitruvian Man)
- Not hyper-realistic - schematic is better
- 2px line weight for main figure
- Thinner lines (1-1.5px) for overlays
- Maintain simplicity - don't overcrowd

**Personal Connection Strategy:**
- This makes it REAL for the reader
- They're not just learning about abstract patterns
- They ARE the pattern
- Use phrasing like "Your body," "You are built," etc.

**Alternative Enhancement:**
- Could add small DNA double helix in corner
- Shows the pattern exists at molecular level too
- Reinforces "encoded in every atom"

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Da Vinci understood this 500 years ago
- **Modern precision:** Accurate measurements and ratios
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real math, real bodies

**Educational Value:**
This image proves Golden Ratio isn't just aesthetic - it's FUNDAMENTAL to human biology.
