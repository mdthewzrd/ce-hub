# IMAGE SPECIFICATION

**Image ID:** INT_02

**Title:** Spiral Galaxy Pattern Comparison

**Chapter:** Introduction

**Purpose:** Scale comparison - show same pattern at cosmic scale

**Category:** Cosmic Pattern

## REFERENCE IMAGE

**Search Terms:**
- "spiral galaxy face-on"
- "galaxy spiral arms clearly visible"
- "whirlpool galaxy M51 photograph"

**Source URL:** [To be searched and collected]

**Saved As:** /illustrations/references/chapter_00_intro/ref_galaxy.jpg

**Description:** A high-quality photograph of a spiral galaxy viewed face-on, clearly showing the spiral arms. Should be well-exposed with good contrast. M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy) or similar would be ideal.

## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Original photo, slightly darkened (80% brightness)
- **Line Color:** White (#ffffff) with subtle blue glow
- **Line Weight:** 2px (slightly thicker than nautilus for visibility on dark background)
- **Opacity:** 70% (photo is dark, so higher opacity okay)

### Elements to Include
1. **Galaxy photograph** - Use as-is, darken to 80% for better line visibility
2. **Spiral arm overlay** - Trace the main spiral arms of the galaxy
3. **Center marker** - Gold dot at galactic center (4px)
4. **Scale indicator** - "100,000 light-years across" (optional, in corner)

### Labels & Text
- **Font:** Cinzel Regular (for main text)
- **Size:** 16pt (print), 20px (digital)
- **Color:** White (#ffffff) with subtle glow
- **Content:** "From Atoms to Galaxies: The Same Spiral"
- **Secondary label:** Space Mono, 10pt, gray (#9e9e9e)
- **Content:** "Spiral Galaxy M51 - 100,000 light-years across"

### Dimensions
- **Primary Use:** Full-page book illustration, Instagram feed
- **Size:** 1080x1080px (square), 2400x2400px at 300 DPI (print)

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### File Formats
- **SVG:** int_02_galaxy_spiral.svg
- **PNG:** int_02_galaxy_spiral.png (300 DPI)

### File Naming

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This image creates scale comparison. Pair with INT_01 (nautilus) in layout.**

**Layout Suggestion:**
- Place nautilus on left page
- Place galaxy on right page
- Connect with small text: "Same Pattern, Different Scale"

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** "As above, so below" - hermetic principle
- **Modern precision:** Accurate galactic structure
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real astronomical photo

## AI AGENT PROMPT

```
Please trace the spiral arm structure from the reference galaxy photo.

Requirements:
- Darken photo to 80% brightness
- Use white (#ffffff) lines, 2px weight
- Add subtle blue glow to lines (outer glow, 3px, opacity 50%)
- Set line opacity to 70%
- Add gold (#ffd700) center dot (4px)
- Include main label "From Atoms to Galaxies: The Same Spiral" (Cinzel, 16pt, white)
- Include secondary label with galaxy name and scale (Space Mono, 10pt, gray)
- Maintain accurate galactic structure

Output: SVG and PNG formats
