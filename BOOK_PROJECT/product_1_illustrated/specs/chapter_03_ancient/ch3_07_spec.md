## SPECIAL NOTES

**This introduces the MODERN REDISCOVERY of ancient wisdom.**

**The Key Narrative:**

**Not "New Age" - "Ancient Age":**
- Rodin didn't invent something new
- He REDISCOVERED something ancient
- The Number Map was known, then lost
- He found it again
- This VALIDATES ancient understanding

**The Bridge:**
- Ancient civilizations: KNEW
- Gap period: FORGOT
- Rodin: REMEMBERED
- We're now: LEARNING FROM HIM

**Why This Matters:**
- If Rodin "invented" this, maybe it's wrong
- But he REDISCOVERED it - means ancient people KNEW
- This is VINDICATION of ancient wisdom
- We're catching up to what they understood

**Teaching Points:**

**The Rediscovery Pattern:**
- Rodin studied deeply, looked for patterns
- Found the Number Map through insight
- Realized it explained EVERYTHING
- Tesla understood 3-6-9, but Rodin mapped the whole system
- This isn't just theory - it's PRACTICAL

**Validation of Ancients:**
- Ancient Egyptians: Had the pattern
- Greeks: Understood the geometry
- Tesla: Grasped 3-6-9
- Rodin: Mapped the complete system
- Each builds on previous understanding

**The "Crackpot" Defense:**
- Critics: "This is new age nonsense"
- Reality: "It's ancient wisdom being remembered"
- The Number Map appears in ancient texts
- Tesla referenced 3-6-9 explicitly
- This is REMEMBRANCE, not invention

**Visualization Strategy:**

**Portrait + Number Map:**
- Humanizes the rediscovery
- Shows Rodin as regular person who had extraordinary insight
- Number Map demonstrates what he found
- Makes it tangible and real

**Connection Lines:**
- Visual connection to ancient sources
- Shows he's part of a lineage
- Not a lone genius, but one link in a chain
- Standing on shoulders of giants

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Rediscovering what was known
- **Modern precision:** Mathematical accuracy
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real person, real mathematics, real discovery

**Educational Value:**
This teaches:
- VBM isn't "new age" - it's "ancient age"
- Rodin's role is REMEMBERING, not inventing
- Ancient civilizations are validated
- We're part of a lineage of understanding

**Connection to Other Images:**
- CH2_01: Number Map (what Rodin rediscovered)
- CH2_02: Doubling Circuit (part of rediscovery)
- CH2_03: 3-6-9 (Tesla's key, Rodin mapped it)
- CH3_06: Gap period (what preceded rediscovery)
- CH3_08: Plasmoids (scientific validation)
