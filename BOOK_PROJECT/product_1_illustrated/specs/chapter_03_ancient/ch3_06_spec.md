**What Was Lost:**
- Understanding of energy as toroidal flow
- Knowledge that consciousness creates reality
- Recognition of sacred geometry as fundamental
- Connection to ancient wisdom
- Label: "400 Years of Forgetting" (Cinzel, 18pt, gray)

**Why It Happened:**
- Rise of materialist philosophy
- Church vs Science conflict
- Industrialization needed "conquer nature" mindset
- Measurement became only valid truth
- Label: "The Cost of Progress" (Cinzel, 16pt, dark gray)

### Labels & Text

- **Content:** "The Gap: 400 Years of Forgetting (1600-1990)"
- **Subtitle:** Inter Italic, 14pt, gray
- **Content:** "Materialist science dismissed sacred geometry as superstition. We almost lost everything."
- **Period labels:** Inter SemiBold, 12pt, gray/dark gray
- **Event descriptions:** Inter Regular, 10pt, lighter gray
- **Timeline:** Dashed gray line, 2px

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This explains WHY we forgot what we once knew.**

**The Question:**
"How did we go from worldwide understanding of sacred geometry to complete dismissal?"

**The Answer:**
The Gap Period. 400 years of materialist science, reductionist thinking, and dismissal of anything "non-measurable."

**The Narrative Arc:**

**Before (Ancient):** Rich, full understanding
**During (Gap):** Diminished, foggy, almost lost
**After (Rediscovery):** Emerging, renewing

**Key Insight:**
This wasn't accidental. This was a PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT.

**Materialism:**
- Only matter is real
- Consciousness is just brain chemistry
- If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist
- Ancient wisdom = superstition

**The Cost:**
We lost connection to:
- Understanding of energy's true nature
- Knowledge of consciousness as fundamental
- Recognition of mathematical patterns in reality
- Connection to ancient wisdom

**Tesla Exception:**
Tesla understood 3-6-9, but his work was suppressed/lost. One person keeping the flame alive, but dimly.

**Visualization Strategy:**

**Fog Effect:**
- Create visual sense of "lost in fog"
- Dim, obscured colors
- Dashed, broken timeline
- Events feel distant, unclear

**Tesla as Exception:**
- Only gold/bright element in Gap
- Shows knowledge wasn't COMPLETELY lost
- But suppressed, not mainstream
- One light in the darkness

**Teaching Points:**

**This Explains So Much:**
- Why mainstream science dismisses sacred geometry
- why this seems "new" or "alternative"
- Why ancient civilizations seemed "primitive"
- Why we're only now rediscovering

**The Paradigm Shift:**
- Ancient: Consciousness creates reality
- Gap: Matter is all that's real
- Emerging: Consciousness AND matter both fundamental

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** What was lost during Gap
- **Modern precision:** Timeline shows historical progression
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real history, real philosophical shift

**Educational Value:**
This teaches:
- The Gap wasn't accidental - it was philosophical
- Materialist science has limits
- We're still recovering from 400 years of forgetting
- The rediscovery is overcoming deep conditioning

**Connection to Other Images:**
- CH3_01: Timeline (Gap as one period)
- CH3_05: Renaissance (before Gap)
- CH3_07: Rediscovery (after Gap)
- CH2_06: Tesla (exception during Gap)
