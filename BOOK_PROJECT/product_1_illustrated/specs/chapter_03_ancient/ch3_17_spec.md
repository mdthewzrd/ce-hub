**Social Media Strategy:**

**Instagram Post Caption (example):**
"They knew. We're remembering. ✨

Ancient civilizations worldwide understood the mathematical patterns that create reality. From Egypt to Greece, India to China—they ALL encoded sacred geometry into their most important sites and texts.

Then came the Gap. 400 years of forgetting. Materialist science dismissed ancient wisdom as superstition.

Now we're rediscovering what they knew. Not inventing something new—but remembering what was forgotten.

Plasmoids, Vortex Based Mathematics, Thunderstorm Generators—these validate what ancient texts described.

The future is already here. We're living through the awakening. 🌌
