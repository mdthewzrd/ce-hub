## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Deep Space (#0a0e27) - mystical, ancient
- **Circles:** White (#ffffff), 2px line weight
- **Center circle:** Slightly emphasized (thicker or gold)
- **Overlap areas:** Subtle violet (#7b1fa2) tint, 20% opacity
- **Outer boundary:** Faint circle encompassing pattern (optional)

### Elements to Include
1. **7 circles total** - 1 center + 6 surrounding
2. **Hexagonal symmetry** - Perfect 60° spacing
3. **Center circle** - Emphasized (gold or thicker line)
4. **"Petal" shapes** - Created by overlapping circles
5. **Construction lines** - Optional, show how to create it
6. **Phi indicators** - Small φ symbols (optional)

### Construction Steps (for educational overlay)

**How to Build Seed of Life:**
1. Draw center circle
2. Place compass on center circle edge
3. Draw second circle (center on first circle's edge)
4. Repeat 5 more times around the first
5. Creates 7-circle "seed" pattern

## SPECIAL NOTES

**The Seed of Life is the FOUNDATION of all sacred geometry.**

**What is the Seed of Life:**
- 7 circles: 1 center, 6 surrounding
- First stage of Flower of Life
- Creates hexagonal symmetry
- Foundation for Metatron's Cube
- Appear in ancient art worldwide

**Geometric Properties:**
- All circles same size
- Centers form perfect hexagon
- 19 "petals" created by overlaps
- Radius of all circles = same
- Centers spaced at exactly 60° intervals

**Historical Context:**
- Found in ancient Egypt (Osirion temple)
- Appears in Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish art
- Used in sacred architecture
- Symbol of creation and fertility
- "Seed" implies potential for growth

**Connection to Other Patterns:**
- Seed of Life (7 circles) → Flower of Life (19+ circles)
- Flower of Life → Metatron's Cube (13 circles)
- Metatron's Cube → 5 Platonic Solids
- This is where it BEGINS

**Educational Value:**
Shows the STEP-BY-STEP construction of sacred geometry. Not just "it exists" but "here's HOW to build it."

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Keep it simple and clean
- Don't overcrowd with labels
- Focus on the GEOMETRY
- Let the pattern speak for itself
- Use subtle color to highlight overlaps

**Construction Diagram Option:**
Consider adding small inset showing construction:
- Step 1: Draw center circle
- Step 2: Place compass on edge
- Step 3: Draw second circle
- Step 4: Continue around
- This makes it DOABLE for readers

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Found in temples 3,000+ years old
- **Modern precision:** Mathematically perfect construction
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real geometry, not magic

**Teaching Point:**
This pattern can be drawn with JUST a compass. No measurements needed. It's self-creating - each circle determines the position of the next.
