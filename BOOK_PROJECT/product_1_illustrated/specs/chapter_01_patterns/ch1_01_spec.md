### Elements to Include
1. **19 overlapping circles** - Complete Flower of Life
2. **Central flower** (7 circles) - Highlighted in gold
3. **Outer petals** (12 circles) - In white
4. **Subtle glow** - Radial gradient from center (blue to transparent)
5. **Perfect symmetry** - Hexagonal alignment must be precise

### Labels & Text
- **Main Label:** Cinzel SemiBold, 18pt, white
- **Content:** "The Flower of Life: Nature's Master Pattern"
- **Note:** No other text - let the pattern speak

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### File Formats
- **SVG:** ch1_01_flower_of_life.svg (preferred for precision)
- **PNG:** ch1_01_flower_of_life.png (300 DPI)

### Quality Check
- [ ] All circles are perfect (true circles, not distorted)
- [ ] Overlap pattern is accurate (circles intersect correctly)
- [ ] Center 7 circles form perfect flower
- [ ] Hexagonal symmetry is precise (60° angles)
- [ ] Gold/white color distinction is clear
- [ ] Glow effect is subtle, not overpowering
- [ ] Lines are smooth (no pixelation)

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a KEY sacred geometry diagram. Must be geometrically perfect.**

**Mathematical Accuracy:**
- Center circle radius = r
- All other circles have same radius = r
- Circle centers at distance r from adjacent centers
- Creates perfect hexagonal packing

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** This pattern is thousands of years old
- **Modern precision:** Computer-perfect geometry
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real mathematical pattern

**Usage:** This will be referenced throughout the book as the foundation pattern.
