## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Deep Space (#0a0e27) - makes energy effects pop
- **Torus form:** White (#ffffff), 2px outline, semi-transparent fill
- **Energy flow:** Gold (#ffd700) with glow, 2px arrows/lines
- **Center axis:** Violet (#7b1fa2), dashed line showing rotation
- **Flow direction:** Curved arrows showing continuous loop

### Elements to Include
1. **3D torus shape** - Doughnut form, angled view
2. **Flow arrows** - Showing energy movement:
   - In through top (central axis)
   - Spirals around outside
   - Flows through center hole
   - Out bottom
   - Returns to top (continuous loop)
3. **Cross-section** - Show donut shape clearly
4. **Axis line** - Vertical dashed line through center
5. **Vortex indicators** - Small swirls showing spiral motion
6. **Glow effects** - Subtle glow on flow lines

### Flow Pattern to Show

**The Energy Loop:**
```
        ↓ (in)
       ___
     /     \  ← spirals around outside
    |  ___  |
    | |   | |  ← flows through center
    | |___| |
     \_____/
        ↓ (out)
```

**Arrows Should Show:**
- Entry: Vertical down through center
- Outside spiral: Curved around exterior
- Center flow: Up through donut hole
- Exit: Vertical up from center
- Return: Curves back to top

### Labels & Text

- **Content:** "The Torus: Energy's Natural Shape"
- **Subtitle:** Inter Italic, 12pt, white
- **Content:** "Energy flows in, spirals around, flows through, returns"
- **Flow labels:** Small labels showing direction (Inter, 10pt, white)
  - "Energy enters" (top)
  - "Spirals around" (outside)
  - "Flows through center" (center)
  - "Energy exits" (bottom)
- **Note:** "From atoms to galaxies, energy flows this way" (Space Mono, 11pt, violet)

## SPECIAL NOTES

**The torus is the SHAPE of energy - from atoms to galaxies.**

**What is a Torus:**
- Doughnut shape (3D ring)
- Forms naturally in spinning systems
- Most energy-efficient shape
- Creates self-sustaining flow
- Appears at ALL scales in nature

**Energy Flow Pattern:**
1. **In**: Energy enters along central axis
2. **Out**: Moves to equator (widest part)
3. **Around**: Spirals around outside
4. **Through**: Flows back through center
5. **Return**: Completes the loop
6. **Repeat**: Continuous, self-sustaining

**Examples in Nature:**
- **Atoms**: Electron probability clouds are toroidal
- **Magnetic fields**: Earth's magnetic field is a torus
- **Hurricanes**: Toroidal flow pattern
- **Galaxies**: Matter flows in toroidal patterns
- **Fruit**: Apples, tomatoes grow in torus shapes
- **Smoke rings**: Toroidal vortices

**Why This Shape:**
- Most efficient for spinning systems
- Self-sustaining flow
- Balance between expansion (outside) and contraction (center)
- Creates stability
- Maximizes surface area to volume ratio

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Use 3D rendering or precise technical drawing
- Angled view (not side-on) shows both outside and center
- Cross-section helps understand donut shape
- Flow arrows should be GOLD (energy)
- Use curved arrows, not straight
- Add small motion lines to suggest movement

**Teaching Point:**
This isn't just an abstract shape - it's HOW ENERGY MOVES in nature. Every spinning system creates a torus.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Many cultures depicted torus energy flow
- **Modern precision:** Accurate 3D rendering, physics-based
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real physics, observable in nature

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small inset images of torus examples:
- Apple (cross-section shows torus)
- Smoke ring
- Magnetic field lines
- Hurricane satellite image

**Alternative Visualization:**
Could use semi-transparent torus and show "energy particles" flowing along the path - makes the movement more concrete.
