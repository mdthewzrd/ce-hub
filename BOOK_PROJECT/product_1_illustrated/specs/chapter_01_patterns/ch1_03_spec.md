## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a KEY "aha moment" image - must be dramatic and clear.**

**Visual Impact:**
- The revelation should be striking
- Make sure the spiral tracing is accurate (this is the educational moment)
- Consider adding subtle glow to the spiral line for emphasis

**Golden Spiral Accuracy:**
- The spiral should follow the actual seed arrangement
- Start at center and spiral outward
- The spiral should naturally follow the seed pattern
- Use genuine Fibonacci spiral, not just any spiral

**Layout Options:**
- Alternative: Top/bottom split instead of left/right
- Alternative: Fade transition between images
- Current: Side-by-side is clearest for comparison

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Fibonacci discovered this 800 years ago
- **Modern precision:** Accurate mathematical tracing
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real photo, not abstraction

**Usage Note:**
This image teaches people HOW to see the pattern. Make the spiral very clear and obvious.
