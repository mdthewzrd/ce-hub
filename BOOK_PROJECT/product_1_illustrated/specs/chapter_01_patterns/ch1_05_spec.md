## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Light Parchment (#faf5e6) - educational feel
- **Numbers:** Deep Blue (#1a237e), large and prominent
- **Connecting Lines:** Violet (#7b1fa2), 2px, showing addition
- **Growth Indicators:** Gold (#ffd700), showing expansion
- **Typography:** Space Mono for numbers, Inter for labels

### Elements to Include
1. **Number sequence** - 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
2. **Addition visual** - Show how each number = sum of previous two
3. **Growth pattern** - Numbers get larger (visual size increase)
4. **Golden spiral** - Overlay showing phi relationship
5. **Addition symbols** - Small "+" showing the pattern
6. **Phi indicator** - Show ratio approaching 1.618...

### Layout Options

**Option 1: Horizontal Number Line**
- Numbers arranged left to right
- Arrows showing addition: 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5
- Clean, linear progression

**Option 2: Spiral Layout**
- Numbers arranged in golden spiral
- Shows geometric relationship
- More visual interest

**Option 3: Growing Rectangles**
- Each number as rectangle size
- Shows Fibonacci squares
- Leads into golden rectangle

**Use Option 1 for clarity and educational value**

### Labels & Text
- **Title:** Cinzel Regular, 18pt, Deep Blue (#1a237e)
- **Content:** "The Fibonacci Sequence"
- **Subtitle:** Inter Regular, 12pt, gray
- **Content:** "Each number is the sum of the two before it"
- **Numbers:** Space Mono SemiBold, 48pt (decreasing to 24pt), Deep Blue
- **Addition indicators:** Small "+", Inter, 20pt, violet
- **Ratio:** "Ratio → 1.618..." (Space Mono, 14pt, gold)
- **Example calculation:** Small showing: 5 + 8 = 13 (Inter, 11pt, gray)

### Dimensions
- **Primary Use:** Educational teaching diagram, full page
- **Size:** 1400x600px (horizontal, wide format)
- **DPI:** 300

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a CORE teaching moment - explains the fundamental sequence.**

**The Mathematical Pattern:**
```
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
8 + 13 = 21
13 + 21 = 34
21 + 34 = 55
34 + 55 = 89
55 + 89 = 144
```

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Show first 12 numbers (enough to see pattern)
- Each number visually larger than previous (slightly)
- Use "+" signs between numbers to show addition
- Could use curved arrows: 1 ↗ 1 ↘ 2 (showing flow)
- Keep it simple - don't overcrowd

**Teaching Approach:**
- Start with the rule: "Each number = sum of two before it"
- Show the sequence
- Give one example calculation
- Point out the ratio approaching phi

**Why This Matters:**
This sequence appears EVERYWHERE in nature. It's not just abstract math - it's the code of growth and expansion in the natural world.

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small visual cues:
- Arrow thickness increases with each number
- Number size increases slightly (not proportional, just suggestive)
- Color gradient: starts dark blue, gets slightly lighter
- Small phi symbol appearing after 8, 13, 21 (showing convergence)

**Alternative Idea:**
Could add small natural examples under key numbers:
- 8: Pinecone (8 spirals one way)
- 13: Pinecone (13 spirals other way)
- 21: Sunflower (often has 21 spirals)
- 34: Another sunflower example
- 55: Larger sunflower
- 89: Sunflower with 89 spirals

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Fibonacci discovered this in 1202 AD, studying nature
- **Modern precision:** Exact mathematical sequence
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real math, not magic
