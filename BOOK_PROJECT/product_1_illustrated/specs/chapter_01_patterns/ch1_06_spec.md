## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Light Parchment (#faf5e6) - mathematical/educational
- **Line Segment:** Deep Blue (#1a237e), 4px, thick and prominent
- **Division Point:** Gold (#ffd700), circle marker
- **Formula:** Violet (#7b1fa2), clear typography
- **Labels:** Space Mono for math, Inter for explanations

### Elements to Include
1. **Line segment** - Horizontal line, divided at golden ratio
2. **Segment labels** - Show "a", "b", and "a+b"
3. **Golden ratio formula** - (a+b)/a = a/b = φ
4. **Numerical value** - φ = 1.618034...
5. **Visual proof** - Show why it's "golden"
6. **Comparison** - Compare to other ratios (1:2, 2:3, etc.)
7. **Phi symbol** - Large, prominent φ

### Mathematical Explanation

**The Golden Ratio Definition:**
A line is divided into two parts, a (longer) and b (shorter), such that:
```
(a + b) / a = a / b = φ = 1.618034...
```

**The Formula:**
```
φ² = φ + 1
1.618² = 1.618 + 1
2.618 = 2.618 ✓
```

**Why It's Special:**
- Only ratio where the whole is to the larger as the larger is to the smaller
- Creates perfect proportion and balance
- Found throughout nature and art

### Labels & Text
- **Title:** Cinzel Regular, 20pt, Deep Blue (#1a237e)

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This explains the MATHEMATICS behind the pattern.**

**Visualization Strategy:**

**Main Element - Golden Division:**
```
|--------- a + b ---------|
         |----- a -----|--- b ---|
                   ↑
                (division point)
```

Show that:
- (a+b)/a = 1.618...
- a/b = 1.618...
- Both equal φ

**Multiple Visuals to Include:**

1. **Line segment division** (main element)
   - Thick horizontal line
   - Division point marked with gold circle
   - Labels: "a + b", "a", "b"

2. **Golden Rectangle** (secondary)
   - Rectangle divided by square
   - Shows same ratio geometrically
   - Smaller, in corner

3. **Formula Display** (prominent)
   - (a+b)/a = a/b = φ
   - φ² = φ + 1
   - φ = (1 + √5) / 2

4. **Numerical Value**
   - φ = 1.618033988749...
   - Show several decimal places
   - Emphasize "1.618..." as the key

5. **Comparison Box** (educational)
   - 1:2 = 0.5
   - 2:3 = 0.667
   - 3:5 = 0.6
   - 5:8 = 0.625
   - 8:13 = 0.615...
   - φ = 0.618... (converges here)

**Teaching Approach:**
- Start with visual (line divided)
- Show the formula
- Prove it mathematically
- Give the numerical value
- Compare to "normal" ratios

**Why It Matters:**
This is the MOST efficient ratio in nature. Plants arrange leaves at 137.5° (related to φ) for maximum sunlight exposure.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Greeks called this "divine proportion"
- **Modern precision:** Exact mathematical formula
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real math, provable, not magic

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small callout: "Nature's optimization code"
