## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Deep Space (#0a0e27) - mystical, creation feel
- **Circles:** White (#ffffff), 2px line weight
- **Central flower:** Gold (#ffd700) tint, 30% opacity
- **3D effect:** Subtle shading to show depth
- **Center point:** Emphasized with glow

### Elements to Include
1. **8 circles total** - Arranged in egg-like pattern
2. **Central cluster** - 7 circles forming hexagon (like Seed of Life)
3. **Eighth circle** - Enclosing the others, creating "egg" shape
4. **3D perspective** - Show it's a rotating structure
5. **Cellular pattern** - Shows embryonic cell division
6. **Rotation indicators** - Small curved arrows showing 3D rotation

### Pattern Construction

**From Seed of Life to Egg of Life:**
1. Start with Seed of Life (7 circles)
2. Rotate pattern 90°
3. Creates 8th circle position
4. Forms complete "egg" shape
5. Represents embryonic development

**Geometric Properties:**
- 7 circles in hexagonal cluster
- 1 enclosing circle
- Creates 3D spherical structure
- All circles same size
- Forms rotating sphere pattern

## SPECIAL NOTES

**The Egg of Life represents the STAGE of creation and development.**

**What is the Egg of Life:**
- 8 circles in specific arrangement
- Second stage of sacred geometry construction
- Forms 3D rotating structure
- Represents embryonic development
- Precedes Flower of Life

**Construction Sequence:**
1. **Seed of Life** (7 circles) - Foundation
2. **Egg of Life** (8 circles) - Development
3. **Flower of Life** (19+ circles) - Full expansion
4. **Fruit of Life** (13 circles) - Metatron's Cube base
5. **Metatron's Cube** - Complete system

**Biological Connection:**
- Mirrors first cell divisions (embryo)
- 1 cell → 2 cells → 4 cells → 8 cells
- Geometrically identical to embryonic development
- "Egg" is literal AND metaphorical
- Life begins with this pattern

**Symbolism:**
- **Creation**: Pattern of life emerging
- **Fertility**: Egg = birth, potential
- **Development**: Stage between seed and flower
- **Balance**: Symmetry and proportion
- **Rotation**: Dynamic, not static

**3D Structure:**
- Not flat - it's a rotating sphere
- 8 spheres arranged in 3D space
- Forms complete geometric structure
- All spheres same size
- Creates stable configuration

**Why It Matters:**
This pattern shows the STAGES of growth. Not just "life exists" but "life DEVELOPS this way." The geometry mirrors biological reality.

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Use 3D perspective (show rotation)
- Add subtle depth/shading
- Make central cluster gold (life force)
- Enclosing circle white (boundary/protection)
- Add small curved arrows to show 3D rotation
- Keep it elegant and mystical

**Teaching Point:**
This isn't just abstract geometry - it's HOW LIFE BEGINS. The first cell divisions in an embryo follow this EXACT pattern.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Understood by sacred traditions
- **Modern precision:** Confirmed by embryology
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real biology, real geometry

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small inset showing:
- First cell division (1 → 2 → 4 → 8)
- Embryo at 8-cell stage
- Shows pattern isn't just symbolic

**Advanced Note:**
The 8 spheres can be arranged to form a specific 3D structure called the "star tetrahedron" when connected - another layer of the pattern.
