## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a KEY educational image - demonstrates pattern recognition.**

**Photo Quality Requirements:**
- Each photo must be high resolution (minimum 1000px)
- Spiral pattern must be clearly visible
- Lighting should be good (no dark, muddy images)
- Variety of scales shown (micro to macro)

**Composition Notes:**
- Mix of object types (plants, animals, cosmic, weather)
- Mix of scales (small to large)
- Mix of colors (but maintain visual harmony)
- Arrange in visually interesting pattern

**Alternative Approach:**
If collecting 12 photos is difficult, can use 6-8 high-quality examples in 2x3 or 2x4 grid.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Nature has always followed these patterns
- **Modern precision:** Scientific, categorized presentation
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real photos, not speculation
