## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Original photo, no color treatment (or slight brightening)
- **Line Color:** White (#ffffff) for both spiral directions
- **Line Weight:** 2px (needs to be visible on textured surface)
- **Opacity:** 70% (allow texture to show through)

### Elements to Include
1. **Original pinecone photo** - Use as-is, may brighten slightly
2. **Clockwise spiral tracing** - White, follow one spiral direction
3. **Counter-clockwise spiral tracing** - White, follow other spiral direction
4. **Number indicators** - Small dots or numbers showing the count
5. **Count labels** - "8 spirals one way, 13 the other" (Space Mono)

### Labels & Text
- **Main Label:** Cinzel Regular, 14pt, white with dark background
- **Content:** "Count the Spirals: 8 and 13"
- **Direction Arrows:** Small curved arrows showing spiral directions
- **Numbers:** "8" and "13" in circles (white circles, gold text, Space Mono, 12pt)
- **Note:** "Both Fibonacci Numbers" (Inter Italic, 10pt, gold)

### Dimensions
- **Primary Use:** Educational example, full page or half-page
- **Size:** 1080x1080px (square)
- **DPI:** 300

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a critical educational image - demonstrates Fibonacci in nature.**

**The Mathematical Fact:**
- Pinecones typically have 8 spirals one direction, 13 the other
- Both 8 and 13 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers
- This pattern appears in many pinecones (not all, but most)
- This is a genuine mathematical property, not coincidence

**Tracing Tips:**
- Start from the base and follow spirals upward
- Be careful to count accurately
- Use slightly thicker lines (2px) for visibility
- Consider using small dots along the spiral to aid counting

**Alternative Enhancement:**
- Could add small numbered dots along each spiral: 1, 2, 3... 8 and 1, 2, 3... 13
- This makes the counting very explicit for readers

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Nature follows mathematical patterns
- **Modern precision:** Accurate counting and tracing
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real pinecone, real math

**Educational Value:**
This image proves that Fibonacci numbers aren't just theory - they appear in real, tangible ways in nature.

## AI AGENT PROMPT

```
Please trace the Fibonacci spiral patterns on a pinecone.

Requirements:
- Use original pinecone photo (slight brightening OK)
- Trace TWO spiral directions: clockwise and counter-clockwise
- Use white (#ffffff) lines, 2px weight
- Set line opacity to 70% (allow texture to show)
- Add number indicators: small dots or numbers showing the counts
- Label: "Count the Spirals: 8 and 13" (Cinzel, 14pt, white, dark background)
- Add numbers "8" and "13" in white circles with gold text (Space Mono, 12pt)
- Add note: "Both Fibonacci Numbers" (Inter Italic, 10pt, gold)
- Ensure both spiral directions are clearly traced
- Make the counting visual and explicit

Output: Combined PNG with overlays
