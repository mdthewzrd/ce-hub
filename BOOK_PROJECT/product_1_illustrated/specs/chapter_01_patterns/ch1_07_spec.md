## RECREATION SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Style
- **Background:** Deep Space (#0a0e27) - mystical, ancient
- **Circles:** White (#ffffff), 2px line weight, 13 equal circles
- **Lines:** Gold (#ffd700), 1.5px, connecting all circle centers
- **Center Circle:** Slightly larger, emphasized
- **Platonic Highlights:** Violet (#7b1fa2), show 5 solids within

### Elements to Include
1. **13 circles** - Flower of Life base, 1 center + 12 surrounding
2. **Connecting lines** - From center to all other circle centers
3. **Outer circle** - Encompassing the entire pattern
4. **Platonic solids** - Faintly highlighted within the pattern
   - Tetrahedron (4 faces)
   - Cube (6 faces)
   - Octahedron (8 faces)
   - Dodecahedron (12 faces)
   - Icosahedron (20 faces)
5. **Glow effect** - Subtle glow on lines
6. **Phi indicators** - Small φ symbols at key points

### Layout
- **Central circle** - Largest, emphasized
- **12 surrounding circles** - Arranged like Flower of Life
- **Outer boundary** - Circle encompassing all 13
- **Lines radiating** - From center to all other centers
- **Platonic overlays** - Subtle, don't overpower main figure

### Labels & Text
- **Title:** Cinzel Regular, 18pt, Gold (#ffd700)
- **Content:** "Metatron's Cube"
- **Subtitle:** Inter Italic, 12pt, white
- **Content:** "Contains All 5 Platonic Solids"
- **Solid labels:** Small labels for each Platonic solid (Inter, 10pt, violet)
- **Note:** "The blueprint of all matter" (Space Mono, 11pt, white)
- **Circle count:** "13 circles, infinite connections" (Inter, 10pt, gray)

### Dimensions
- **Primary Use:** Sacred geometry showcase, full page
- **Size:** 1200x1200px (square)
- **DPI:** 300

## SPECIAL NOTES

**This is a KEY sacred geometry symbol - contains the Platonic solids.**

**What is Metatron's Cube:**
- Derived from Flower of Life (13 circles)
- Named after Archangel Metatron
- Contains ALL 5 Platonic solids within it
- Considered the "blueprint of the universe"
- Every molecular structure, atomic form, etc. is based on this

**The 13 Circles:**
- 1 center circle
- 12 surrounding circles (like clock face)
- Creates complete 3D connectivity
- Foundation for all geometry

**The 5 Platonic Solids Within:**
1. **Tetrahedron** - 4 faces (fire element)
2. **Cube/Hexahedron** - 6 faces (earth element)
3. **Octahedron** - 8 faces (air element)
4. **Dodecahedron** - 12 faces (ether/universe)
5. **Icosahedron** - 20 faces (water element)

**Visualization Strategy:**
- Draw the 13 circles first
- Connect center to all outer circle centers
- This creates the cube structure
- Platonic solids emerge from these lines
- Use different colors to highlight each solid

**Color Coding (optional but helpful):**
- Tetrahedron: Red tint
- Cube: Green tint
- Octahedron: Blue tint
- Dodecahedron: Purple tint
- Icosahedron: Orange tint
- Keep tints subtle (10-20% opacity)

**Historical Context:**
- Appears in ancient texts
- Found in religious art
- Leonardo da Vinci studied it
- Sacred to multiple traditions

**Teaching Point:**
This isn't just abstract geometry - ancient civilizations believed this was the LITERAL blueprint of creation. Modern physics is finding similar geometric patterns in quantum structures.

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Ancient wisdom:** Direct connection to sacred traditions
- **Modern precision:** Geometrically perfect, mathematically sound
- **Mystical but grounded:** Real geometry, real math, historical fact

**Educational Enhancement:**
Consider adding small callout boxes explaining each Platonic solid:
- "Tetrahedron: 4 triangular faces"
- "Cube: 6 square faces"
- "Octahedron: 8 triangular faces"
- "Dodecahedron: 12 pentagonal faces"
- "Icosahedron: 20 triangular faces"
