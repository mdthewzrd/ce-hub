**The Multiplier Effect:**

**Exponential Growth:**
- Share with 3
- They share with 3 each = 9
- They share with 3 each = 27
- They share with 3 each = 81
- In 4 generations: 81 people from YOUR 3

**The Mathematics:**
- 3^10 = 59,049 people in 10 generations
- From one person sharing with 3
- THIS is how movements grow
- THIS is how we reach critical mass

**Key Principles:**

**Start Small:**
- Share with ONE person
- Just ONE
- Let exponential effect work
- Your single action = massive impact

**Share Excitement, Not Doctrine:**
