[00:00:02] **Speaker**: I've divined and designed not only my

[00:00:06] **Speaker**: own tools but tools that are based on

[00:00:08] **Speaker**: perfection and the axiom was the

[00:00:10] **Speaker**: universal truths of the universe

[00:00:12] **Speaker**: essentially I I claimed to have

[00:00:15] **Speaker**: discovered perfection the secret of the

[00:00:17] **Speaker**: axis so my work not only dovetails with

[00:00:21] **Speaker**: other scientists but also encompasses

[00:00:23] **Speaker**: them and they've always treated me with

[00:00:26] **Speaker**: love in high regard I appreciate that

[00:00:29] **Speaker**: and I'm very thankful because they're

[00:00:31] **Speaker**: all hoping that whoever may be that will

[00:00:35] **Speaker**: you know that will pierce the veil and

[00:00:41] **Speaker**: usher mankind to the next Ashkelon of

[00:00:44] **Speaker**: science that's what I claim to do claim

[00:00:46] **Speaker**: to using my new discovery of this new

[00:00:50] **Speaker**: energy to make coils and motors I claim

[00:00:53] **Speaker**: to obsolete the combustion engine I

[00:00:55] **Speaker**: claim to get rid of the space shuttle I

[00:00:58] **Speaker**: don't need rocket fuel I can do it based

[00:01:02] **Speaker**: on using an electrical venturi using my

[00:01:04] **Speaker**: quota to create what I call localized

[00:01:05] **Speaker**: space-time implosion is so powerful that

[00:01:08] **Speaker**: I used the coil and to turn into a

[00:01:10] **Speaker**: nozzle for transportation

[00:01:14] **Speaker**: miracles happen

[00:01:16] **Speaker**: different things happen you know I've

[00:01:20] **Speaker**: had a remember when um I've been we

[00:01:23] **Speaker**: owned a tennis club valley tennis the

[00:01:24] **Speaker**: Swim Club me and my dad in San Diego I

[00:01:26] **Speaker**: just trimmed all the trees I was asleep

[00:01:28] **Speaker**: in my room from carrying the the

[00:01:31] **Speaker**: branches that was exhausted and I was

[00:01:33] **Speaker**: thought I was in the deep darkest sleep

[00:01:36] **Speaker**: it's so so much so I couldn't even dream

[00:01:38] **Speaker**: and all of a sudden an energy shot like
from the farthest other side of the 
[00:01:42] **Speaker**: solar system right through my door and

[00:01:43] **Speaker**: stopped in front of me in the room and I
heard all these voices it sound like a 
[00:01:47] **Speaker**: course of angels saying

[00:01:48] **Speaker**: aerodynamics and the ass just kept on

[00:01:52] **Speaker**: going for like 30 seconds to start

[00:01:53] **Speaker**: crackling and I for setup instantly and
I said who's there 
[00:01:58] **Speaker**: I thought someone had broken into the

[00:01:59] **Speaker**: room turn on a light I was a two-inch

[00:02:01] **Speaker**: particle would doorway like 200 plus

[00:02:04] **Speaker**: pounds was closed it was latched that's

[00:02:08] **Speaker**: pretty serious you know there's there's

[00:02:13] **Speaker**: miracles in this world they say in the

[00:02:16] **Speaker**: human being has folded up all the worlds

[00:02:20] **Speaker**: of God is contained inside us so I did

[00:02:24] **Speaker**: all this math to realize what our

[00:02:27] **Speaker**: potential is you know to become as close

[00:02:31] **Speaker**: to God as we can the purpose of God is

[00:02:33] **Speaker**: for us to read the scriptures to deepen

[00:02:35] **Speaker**: on so we did we develop you know it's

[00:02:38] **Speaker**: called a you know a lofty countenance a

[00:02:42] **Speaker**: good you know good posture or good um

[00:02:47] **Speaker**: you know this is the it's called the

[00:02:50] **Speaker**: comely and most beautiful names of God

[00:02:52] **Speaker**: which are attributes like justice love

[00:02:54] **Speaker**: compassion forbearance

[00:03:27] **Speaker**: [Music]

[00:03:33] **Speaker**: the sound of the course of angels

[00:03:36] **Speaker**: singing I heard all these voices a solid

[00:03:39] **Speaker**: of course event attracts received via

[00:03:42] **Speaker**: nature's transceiver or antenna system

[00:03:44] **Speaker**: Marcos brain whatever it is

[00:04:21] **Speaker**: starting 3 1 before it was to base 10

[00:04:29] **Speaker**: members to start counting now see I can

[00:04:31] **Speaker**: get 7 2 3 5 7 those are all prime

[00:04:47] **Speaker**: numbers natural phenomenon okay 101 the

[00:04:51] **Speaker**: pulse sequence through every prime

[00:04:52] **Speaker**: number between 2 and 101 we're gonna
call now 
[00:05:02] **Speaker**: through the use of vortex based

[00:05:04] **Speaker**: mathematics turns out that all prime

[00:05:06] **Speaker**: numbers are the only numbers that are

[00:05:08] **Speaker**: toroidal based systems in other words

[00:05:10] **Speaker**: they have a perfect mathematical

[00:05:12] **Speaker**: coherency fair and Thorpe was the first

[00:05:15] **Speaker**: member of mr. Rodin's team to realize
his unique characteristic of prime numbers 
[00:05:20] **Speaker**: professor Scott Nelson from the

[00:05:22] **Speaker**: University of Hawaii

[00:05:23] **Speaker**: soon after wrote a paper entitled the

[00:05:26] **Speaker**: fill in taxes prime number C's we're

[00:05:28] **Speaker**: through using vortex based mathematics

[00:05:30] **Speaker**: was able to predict all prime numbers to

[00:05:33] **Speaker**: the growth of plants this topic is of

[00:05:36] **Speaker**: tremendous interest due to its

[00:05:38] **Speaker**: application to cryptology on the other

[00:05:40] **Speaker**: side of the coin this is very

[00:05:42] **Speaker**: application makes more Coronas work

[00:05:44] **Speaker**: possibly the most dangerous crypto and

[00:06:10] **Speaker**: when we combine this with the data from

[00:06:12] **Speaker**: the amplification of the original signal

[00:06:13] **Speaker**: we get these encrypted pages of text no

[00:06:18] **Speaker**: two are alike and we've uncovered over

[00:06:20] **Speaker**: 10,000 already what does it mean doctor

[00:06:23] **Speaker**: well we have no idea it could be

[00:06:25] **Speaker**: anything it could be the first volume of

[00:06:28] **Speaker**: encyclopedia Galactica how long will it
take to decode it these doctor 
[00:06:42] **Speaker**: or many governments business interests

[00:06:46] **Speaker**: even religious leaders they'd like to

[00:06:48] **Speaker**: see me depart this earth now grandpa I

[00:06:53] **Speaker**: wish sir but before I do I wish to make

[00:06:57] **Speaker**: a small contribution final gesture of

[00:07:00] **Speaker**: goodwill of the people of this little

[00:07:02] **Speaker**: planet of Guinea from

[00:07:07] **Speaker**: [Music]

[00:07:15] **Speaker**: clever girl

[00:07:27] **Speaker**: pages and pages of data over 63,000 and

[00:07:32] **Speaker**: all and on the perimeter of each why did

[00:07:36] **Speaker**: simple registration work but they don't

[00:07:39] **Speaker**: line up they do if you think like a

[00:07:42] **Speaker**: bacon an alien intelligence is going to

[00:07:45] **Speaker**: be more advanced that means the

[00:07:47] **Speaker**: efficiency in functioning on multiple

[00:07:50] **Speaker**: levels and multiple dimensions

[00:07:55] **Speaker**: [Music]

[00:07:58] **Speaker**: yes of course the Primmer for those who

[00:08:01] **Speaker**: you have been participating in our work

[00:08:03] **Speaker**: relating to the 432 Hertz of musical

[00:08:05] **Speaker**: tuning being the only known structure

[00:08:07] **Speaker**: coherent holographic musical tuning

[00:08:09] **Speaker**: verified through vortex based

[00:08:10] **Speaker**: mathematics you will appreciate the

[00:08:12] **Speaker**: shock to notice that the graphic do you

[00:08:14] **Speaker**: some contact as the Primmer perfectly

[00:08:17] **Speaker**: matches the bowed edged triangle that

[00:08:20] **Speaker**: the pure 432 Hertz tone creates in

[00:08:22] **Speaker**: matter as seen here in this image taken

[00:08:25] **Speaker**: by John Stewart Reed and Eric Larson of

[00:08:27] **Speaker**: this 432 Hertz somatic experiment

[00:08:32] **Speaker**: please notice the following what this

[00:08:35] **Speaker**: bowed edge shape really is is something

[00:08:37] **Speaker**: commonly called the star seed and what

[00:08:39] **Speaker**: is now being called the Tryon ray

[00:08:42] **Speaker**: rehydrated into 3d through the work of

[00:08:44] **Speaker**: Michael R Evans in which he

[00:08:46] **Speaker**: substantiates at the Tryon Ray which

[00:08:48] **Speaker**: models one individual pulse of light is

[00:08:51] **Speaker**: the smallest platonic solid which has

[00:08:53] **Speaker**: been previously ignored by all modern

[00:08:56] **Speaker**: academia this new sixth photonic solid

[00:08:59] **Speaker**: now literally gives us the Primmer to

[00:09:01] **Speaker**: begin to rehydrate the five platonic

[00:09:03] **Speaker**: solids and integrate them into our

[00:09:06] **Speaker**: sciences using nature's principles ie no

[00:09:10] **Speaker**: straight lines which means more

[00:09:12] **Speaker**: efficiency and functioning on multiple

[00:09:15] **Speaker**: levels and in multiple dimensions maybe

[00:09:19] **Speaker**: that's why as per many of our anomalous

[00:09:22] **Speaker**: experiments when we input 2 watts into

[00:09:25] **Speaker**: the rodent coil we get over 290 watts

[00:09:27] **Speaker**: out of the center in the old paradigm we

[00:09:30] **Speaker**: would call this extra energy

[00:09:32] **Speaker**: however we know it has increased

[00:09:35] **Speaker**: efficiency for those of you wonderful
people who are on Facebook and would 
[00:09:43] **Speaker**: like to stay in tune with the

[00:09:44] **Speaker**: information please join the cosmic 432
