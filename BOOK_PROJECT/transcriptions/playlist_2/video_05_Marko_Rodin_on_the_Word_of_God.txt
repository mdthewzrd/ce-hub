[00:00:01] **Speaker**: okay ask your question again um do you

[00:00:04] **Speaker**: want to tell me more about your

[00:00:05] **Speaker**: involvement with the bahai faith and how

[00:00:08] **Speaker**: it affected you and your life and your

[00:00:10] **Speaker**: work and how you came across

[00:00:13] **Speaker**: it um there was a man named Paul Mona

[00:00:17] **Speaker**: who now lives on the big island looking

[00:00:20] **Speaker**: for my sister and uh she had moved out

[00:00:24] **Speaker**: of our house in Beverly Hills but I was

[00:00:25] **Speaker**: still there taking care of the dogs and

[00:00:27] **Speaker**: the house and that's all I had as a

[00:00:29] **Speaker**: place to live

[00:00:31] **Speaker**: and so when he she wasn't there I said

[00:00:34] **Speaker**: well you you're welcome to have some tea

[00:00:36] **Speaker**: if you want to come

[00:00:38] **Speaker**: in and so we were sitting and talking

[00:00:40] **Speaker**: and I was explaining how I had had

[00:00:42] **Speaker**: a sudden awareness of The Secret of

[00:00:45] **Speaker**: intelligence how to tap into the full

[00:00:47] **Speaker**: potential of the human brain how you can

[00:00:51] **Speaker**: utilize all the remaining hypothetical

[00:00:53] **Speaker**: 90% remaining unutilized part of the

[00:00:58] **Speaker**: brain and so I said I'd been looking I'd

[00:01:00] **Speaker**: gone to UCLA studying paranormal

[00:01:03] **Speaker**: psychology Altered States the brain

[00:01:04] **Speaker**: Revolution this was in my uh first year

[00:01:08] **Speaker**: of high school second year of high

[00:01:10] **Speaker**: school and he said and I said but the

[00:01:14] **Speaker**: scriptures I had read the Bible the

[00:01:16] **Speaker**: Torah the Quran i' gone to the manly PE

[00:01:19] **Speaker**: Hall um Library the

[00:01:22] **Speaker**: egyptology books of the Dead your Ana

[00:01:25] **Speaker**: book you name it I read through them all

[00:01:27] **Speaker**: but none of them had this the name of

[00:01:29] **Speaker**: God either spelled right or pronounced

[00:01:30] **Speaker**: right and all those scriptures were

[00:01:32] **Speaker**: written for people of an earlier time at

[00:01:34] **Speaker**: a more primitive level and I said while

[00:01:37] **Speaker**: I know they're from God and I can

[00:01:38] **Speaker**: recognize that their Revelation is

[00:01:40] **Speaker**: authentic they're still not for the

[00:01:42] **Speaker**: people of the capacity of this

[00:01:44] **Speaker**: time and he said well what you're

[00:01:46] **Speaker**: looking for is the most great name of

[00:01:48] **Speaker**: God in the bigh faith in the beigh

[00:01:51] **Speaker**: scriptures and he recommended the book

[00:01:52] **Speaker**: of certitude and the hidden words and

[00:01:55] **Speaker**: the Seven valleys and the four valleys

[00:01:57] **Speaker**: the seven valleys or four valleys are

[00:01:59] **Speaker**: the

[00:02:01] **Speaker**: for the male soul the aggression to God

[00:02:05] **Speaker**: and the the gleanings is the tablet of

[00:02:09] **Speaker**: the H or the M of Heaven which had to do

[00:02:13] **Speaker**: with uh the highest station of a woman

[00:02:16] **Speaker**: which her potential capable is of most

[00:02:20] **Speaker**: people think that it's

[00:02:23] **Speaker**: uh from A Different World the H but the

[00:02:26] **Speaker**: H is the it can be any woman it's the

[00:02:29] **Speaker**: station of a woman's

[00:02:31] **Speaker**: Soul uh of of her full

[00:02:35] **Speaker**: magnificence so um it's one of my

[00:02:38] **Speaker**: favorite but High scriptures which Al

[00:02:41] **Speaker**: the leanings which go say step out of

[00:02:42] **Speaker**: thy holy chamber oh made of heaven and

[00:02:44] **Speaker**: made of the Glorious paradise and drape

[00:02:46] **Speaker**: thyself in whatever manner pleaseth thee
in the silk and vesture of immortality 
[00:02:50] **Speaker**: and put on in the name of th all

[00:02:51] **Speaker**: glorious the silk embroidered robe of

[00:02:54] **Speaker**: light so

[00:02:56] **Speaker**: um and it's quite

[00:02:58] **Speaker**: lengthy so um when I got the book of

[00:03:03] **Speaker**: certitude which was revealed in two days

[00:03:04] **Speaker**: and two nights by bahala it's this thick

[00:03:07] **Speaker**: I stayed up for two days without

[00:03:09] **Speaker**: sleeping reading it and by the I was I

[00:03:11] **Speaker**: was a bigh instantly immediately

[00:03:13] **Speaker**: recognized it was authentic it was true

[00:03:15] **Speaker**: it was from God and

[00:03:18] **Speaker**: um how I had been seeking it all out was

[00:03:20] **Speaker**: because I had had an inspiration all my

[00:03:23] **Speaker**: muscles had turned to iron I was I did a

[00:03:27] **Speaker**: thought control experiment in my brain

[00:03:28] **Speaker**: comparing uh the smartest person on

[00:03:31] **Speaker**: earth to the smartest person in another

[00:03:32] **Speaker**: solar system on another planet as far as

[00:03:34] **Speaker**: I could away far as I could away from

[00:03:38] **Speaker**: Earth and

[00:03:40] **Speaker**: um and it worked I figured out that a

[00:03:43] **Speaker**: person's name their language harmonics

[00:03:45] **Speaker**: and the name of God is uh in the

[00:03:48] **Speaker**: scriptures is a brain wve pattern it's

[00:03:50] **Speaker**: the sound and it causes you to

[00:03:56] **Speaker**: um oscillate and Cascade and go to an FR

[00:04:00] **Speaker**: fro and tremble and warble and that's

[00:04:03] **Speaker**: why they chant in the Middle East you

[00:04:06] **Speaker**: know the

[00:04:08] **Speaker**: scriptures so I spent my whole life

[00:04:10] **Speaker**: studying all the the mysticism became a

[00:04:13] **Speaker**: mysticism scholar so in an effort for

[00:04:16] **Speaker**: myself to try to decrypt and learn the
precise Mystic intonation of the most great name of God because it teaches if 
[00:04:22] **Speaker**: you get that you get the Apex of

[00:04:23] **Speaker**: Consciousness The Secret of divine

[00:04:25] **Speaker**: guidance um it's the secret of

[00:04:27] **Speaker**: immortality of the Soul and it's the

[00:04:30] **Speaker**: source of um life to the
soul 
[00:04:38] **Speaker**: yay should I or shouldn't I one more to

[00:04:41] **Speaker**: balance it

[00:04:43] **Speaker**: out no that one balanced it out huh that
one 
[00:04:54] **Speaker**: p so somebody came to look for your

[00:04:58] **Speaker**: sister and you had had a conversation

[00:05:00] **Speaker**: with them I just talked to him two days

[00:05:02] **Speaker**: ago we've been friends

[00:05:06] **Speaker**: for for 40

[00:05:08] **Speaker**: years give or take my sophomore year of

[00:05:11] **Speaker**: high

[00:05:12] **Speaker**: school and

[00:05:15] **Speaker**: so the mathematics of the name of God I

[00:05:18] **Speaker**: couldn't pronounce it and I knew I

[00:05:19] **Speaker**: wasn't saying it correctly it's not said

[00:05:21] **Speaker**: slowly Baha Baha or ABA Raa and a lot of

[00:05:24] **Speaker**: people think by

[00:05:28] **Speaker**: repetitious idal repeti repetition that

[00:05:32] **Speaker**: you

[00:05:34] **Speaker**: accured from it blessings or gifts or

[00:05:37] **Speaker**: power that's not how it works and so

[00:05:41] **Speaker**: um I realize it must be said much

[00:05:45] **Speaker**: differently and that's how from studying

[00:05:47] **Speaker**: the scriptures and learning mysticism

[00:05:49] **Speaker**: that I discover that the be the point

[00:05:51] **Speaker**: the number two that's the bottomless sea

[00:05:54] **Speaker**: the Blackness is nights it becomes

[00:05:55] **Speaker**: almost like a V it's breathe instead of

[00:05:58] **Speaker**: being a

[00:06:00] **Speaker**: B Li Bal frickative anyway and then I

[00:06:05] **Speaker**: applied all those numbers to electrical

[00:06:06] **Speaker**: engineering computer science so I had I

[00:06:09] **Speaker**: took a circle all in the I guess within

[00:06:11] **Speaker**: the first few weeks or months I don't

[00:06:14] **Speaker**: know I instantly read all the bahai

[00:06:17] **Speaker**: books that's why I put the links to the

[00:06:19] **Speaker**: bahai scriptures on my YouTube about

[00:06:22] **Speaker**: page on my channel um which there's a

[00:06:25] **Speaker**: link to it from maror ran.com

[00:06:28] **Speaker**: and um

[00:06:31] **Speaker**: I would have read right now the tablet

[00:06:32] **Speaker**: of the H or

[00:06:35] **Speaker**: the the OD of the dove or something but

[00:06:37] **Speaker**: they're very long not that long I read

[00:06:39] **Speaker**: it to Venus my daughter two nights ago

[00:06:41] **Speaker**: out loud my throat hurts a little though
so 
[00:06:50] **Speaker**: um but I took a circle I couldn't say

[00:06:53] **Speaker**: the name of God I want to see what the

[00:06:54] **Speaker**: number patterns were doing to get the

[00:06:56] **Speaker**: syllables

[00:06:57] **Speaker**: right and so what I did I don't know

[00:07:01] **Speaker**: which one has tea in it it might be this

[00:07:04] **Speaker**: one no only one

[00:07:08] **Speaker**: does so I then um wanted to see how

[00:07:11] **Speaker**: light would be ricocheting inside a

[00:07:13] **Speaker**: circle so I took the one the two which

[00:07:16] **Speaker**: is the B to the one which is the ALF the

[00:07:18] **Speaker**: vows the breath the Hamza the go

[00:07:22] **Speaker**: stop and I then took the five which is

[00:07:26] **Speaker**: the H the ha the Garment and the B mask

[00:07:29] **Speaker**: and the PA

[00:07:30] **Speaker**: feminine um paw

[00:07:35] **Speaker**: uh six and the male is the B which is

[00:07:38] **Speaker**: three and I connected the five to the

[00:07:40] **Speaker**: one and so I had two to one five to one

[00:07:43] **Speaker**: and I had just two lines and then I made

[00:07:45] **Speaker**: a waveform inside the circle just as

[00:07:48] **Speaker**: like a pebble making ripples in a pond
sure 
[00:07:54] **Speaker**: enough I came out with this all in black

[00:07:57] **Speaker**: solid lines this Mobius good I'm glad

[00:07:59] **Speaker**: you like this and this Vector three n

[00:08:04] **Speaker**: and six or three and six opposite each

[00:08:06] **Speaker**: other converging on the nine or vice

[00:08:08] **Speaker**: versa but they were and that after and

[00:08:12] **Speaker**: then 25 years later I put together a

[00:08:14] **Speaker**: team of superb Engineers that's a whole

[00:08:16] **Speaker**: another story and they discovered that

[00:08:18] **Speaker**: this is a flux field the 396 and the

[00:08:21] **Speaker**: 124875 is a coil and it turns out coils

[00:08:25] **Speaker**: are everything our

[00:08:28] **Speaker**: body our hair folding DNA protein

[00:08:31] **Speaker**: everything F folds it's a coil

[00:08:35] **Speaker**: and I have the secret of the universe

[00:08:38] **Speaker**: and it turns out that DNA is paland

[00:08:40] **Speaker**: drone and the pilot wave the 396 is

[00:08:42] **Speaker**: paland drum and so I wanted to vote my

[00:08:45] **Speaker**: life to ending diseases producing

[00:08:47] **Speaker**: unlimited unlimited food because this

[00:08:49] **Speaker**: you can do this with this key this

[00:08:51] **Speaker**: blueprint it's Child's Play any Miracle

[00:08:55] **Speaker**: you can solve as far as um live

[00:08:58] **Speaker**: eternally forever not

[00:09:01] **Speaker**: age

[00:09:03] **Speaker**: um not that it

[00:09:06] **Speaker**: matters because there's probably more to

[00:09:08] **Speaker**: do in the next world than this one but

[00:09:10] **Speaker**: it's not up to me to say or

[00:09:13] **Speaker**: no but the thing is is

[00:09:19] **Speaker**: um I found

[00:09:25] **Speaker**: the God's anagram

[00:09:31] **Speaker**: and I was able

[00:09:33] **Speaker**: to um unlock everything in

[00:09:38] **Speaker**: technology from perfecting quantum

[00:09:40] **Speaker**: mechanics and artificial intelligence so

[00:09:42] **Speaker**: now my work just has to be applied today

[00:09:45] **Speaker**: we were filming and we were going to go

[00:09:47] **Speaker**: over how my Works

[00:09:49] **Speaker**: already been patented for those

[00:09:53] **Speaker**: applications even though the patent is

[00:09:55] **Speaker**: is actually fraudulent because you can't

[00:09:57] **Speaker**: patent something like this it wasn't me

[00:09:59] **Speaker**: who did it it was from a director at

[00:10:03] **Speaker**: Microsoft but this really belongs to God

[00:10:05] **Speaker**: this belongs to

[00:10:06] **Speaker**: humanity and this is a a

[00:10:10] **Speaker**: numerical this is the the numerical

[00:10:13] **Speaker**: formula for

[00:10:16] **Speaker**: spirits and so unless you claim that you

[00:10:19] **Speaker**: are the Fountain Head and you own Spirit

[00:10:24] **Speaker**: which I don't think is going

[00:10:25] **Speaker**: to hold up in

[00:10:28] **Speaker**: court
um it belongs to all 
[00:10:33] **Speaker**: mankind

[00:10:35] **Speaker**: so so now I'm sitting on this phenomenal

[00:10:39] **Speaker**: breakthrough

[00:10:41] **Speaker**: Discovery who do I choose to share it

[00:10:43] **Speaker**: with well Whoever has the most

[00:10:45] **Speaker**: enthusiasm most initiative Drive

[00:10:53] **Speaker**: perseverance no no you can't have can't

[00:10:57] **Speaker**: can't have rank jokes no rank jokes

[00:11:01] **Speaker**: allowed well maybe we'll make a few
exceptions 
[00:11:08] **Speaker**: um and and I do it in such a way is that

[00:11:12] **Speaker**: then everybody can do whatever that

[00:11:15] **Speaker**: serves themselves in humanity and and

[00:11:17] **Speaker**: God because and hopefully it'll be used

[00:11:20] **Speaker**: for peace and positive things to

[00:11:23] **Speaker**: heal I could explain and share and talk

[00:11:26] **Speaker**: about forever but the work is so

[00:11:29] **Speaker**: so volumous now that I it's just nobody

[00:11:33] **Speaker**: has a

[00:11:35] **Speaker**: clue and I and it's so much of a burden

[00:11:38] **Speaker**: and responsibility on me and it's just a

[00:11:40] **Speaker**: mission impossible now to share I was

[00:11:43] **Speaker**: just thinking of all the rough video

[00:11:45] **Speaker**: footage not by me just even other people

[00:11:47] **Speaker**: that I have on my hard drives of their

[00:11:48] **Speaker**: inventions and discoveries it's just too

[00:11:51] **Speaker**: much and that's still just it's the tip

[00:11:54] **Speaker**: of the iceberg so how do you

[00:11:56] **Speaker**: simplify ver me throw money at it
anything works out you can solve 
[00:12:01] **Speaker**: anything just throw money at it but

[00:12:03] **Speaker**: obviously that's not what God has Beque

[00:12:07] **Speaker**: us what were you going to say Marco when

[00:12:09] **Speaker**: I I first came across Vortex

[00:12:13] **Speaker**: mathematics uh over eight years ago one

[00:12:16] **Speaker**: of the the first thing like I didn't

[00:12:18] **Speaker**: even I didn't even finish your lecture
Marco I watched like two hours of it and I immedately started playing with the math because the first thing I realize 
[00:12:24] **Speaker**: is the

[00:12:25] **Speaker**: Simplicity the Simplicity is profound

[00:12:28] **Speaker**: and that can be applied to so many

[00:12:30] **Speaker**: sectors of study and and across the

[00:12:33] **Speaker**: board and it's the Simplicity of the

[00:12:35] **Speaker**: foundation so if it encompasses

[00:12:37] **Speaker**: everything what's the Simplicity because

[00:12:40] **Speaker**: I that's right

[00:12:48] **Speaker**: nobody so everybody is literally blown

[00:12:51] **Speaker**: out of the water by my work because it's

[00:12:53] **Speaker**: so simple see I'm so lucky like some of

[00:12:56] **Speaker**: those endorsement letters I remember one

[00:12:59] **Speaker**: of them talks about how he he couldn't

[00:13:00] **Speaker**: even keep on reading when he was looking

[00:13:02] **Speaker**: through my work he had to go get a drink

[00:13:04] **Speaker**: cuz he was in shock it's it's it's it's

[00:13:08] **Speaker**: blowa away it's awesome but the thing

[00:13:12] **Speaker**: is

[00:13:15] **Speaker**: um what is my work what is this thing

[00:13:18] **Speaker**: this is a okay I'll goad a language it

[00:13:22] **Speaker**: is a schematic it is a blueprint it is a

[00:13:25] **Speaker**: guide it is a and then that way just

[00:13:28] **Speaker**: remind your

[00:13:29] **Speaker**: building um what would I say g a

[00:13:33] **Speaker**: building it is a um

[00:13:35] **Speaker**: instruction it's it's an building

[00:13:40] **Speaker**: instructions we're still waiting on

[00:13:44] **Speaker**: still waiting on food no no don't let

[00:13:46] **Speaker**: her go what's your first name iy see oh

[00:13:49] **Speaker**: IED you on the
phone
