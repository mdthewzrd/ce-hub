[00:00:00] **Speaker**: [Music]

[00:00:13] **Speaker**: [Laughter]

[00:00:20] **Speaker**: our next speaker has dedicated himself

[00:00:24] **Speaker**: for the last six or seven years working

[00:00:26] **Speaker**: with Vortex based mathematics

[00:00:30] **Speaker**: up we're happy to introduce to you Mr
Randy 
[00:00:36] **Speaker**: Powell thank

[00:00:39] **Speaker**: you I appreciate everybody coming

[00:00:43] **Speaker**: out um I hope I don't ruin it for you

[00:00:46] **Speaker**: guys that you know you probably were

[00:00:48] **Speaker**: thinking after the last talk that doing

[00:00:50] **Speaker**: Vortex math makes you goodlooking but uh

[00:00:54] **Speaker**: doesn't always work out that way so

[00:00:57] **Speaker**: sorry um

[00:01:00] **Speaker**: okay so I like to always begin uh before

[00:01:04] **Speaker**: I say anything about myself or what I do

[00:01:07] **Speaker**: and what I've done by giving recognition

[00:01:11] **Speaker**: to uh my teacher Marco Rhoden who uh

[00:01:15] **Speaker**: without whom I definitely wouldn't be

[00:01:17] **Speaker**: here and probably half the people here

[00:01:20] **Speaker**: wouldn't wouldn't be here in in one way

[00:01:22] **Speaker**: or another uh without his tremendous

[00:01:25] **Speaker**: sacrifice and all the hard work he did

[00:01:28] **Speaker**: he discovered the equation that I'm

[00:01:30] **Speaker**: going to talk

[00:01:31] **Speaker**: about uh gosh nearly 40 about 40 years

[00:01:35] **Speaker**: ago so you can imagine uh it's been a a

[00:01:38] **Speaker**: real long road for him I've been in this

[00:01:40] **Speaker**: probably seven years and uh and I'm

[00:01:43] **Speaker**: pretty beat down by it too but uh I'm uh

[00:01:47] **Speaker**: I'm very thankful and and appreciative

[00:01:50] **Speaker**: for him and for all his work and and you

[00:01:52] **Speaker**: know a lot of people recognize what I've

[00:01:55] **Speaker**: done and recognize me but uh but the

[00:01:59] **Speaker**: truth is I really owe it to him and and

[00:02:02] **Speaker**: uh and everything that he's done and a

[00:02:04] **Speaker**: lot of other people too this our project

[00:02:06] **Speaker**: is a very Community project uh people

[00:02:10] **Speaker**: like uh my good friend Tyler Thurman

[00:02:12] **Speaker**: who's done so much video work uh BJ

[00:02:15] **Speaker**: white who did this great animation you

[00:02:18] **Speaker**: know uh people doing applications like

[00:02:20] **Speaker**: Daniel and Erica and Russ Greece who's

[00:02:23] **Speaker**: here and and a whole lot of other people

[00:02:25] **Speaker**: who who aren't here so it goes Way

[00:02:28] **Speaker**: Beyond me and anything that I've done I

[00:02:31] **Speaker**: am glad to just play a role and be a

[00:02:33] **Speaker**: part of it so that out of the way now

[00:02:36] **Speaker**: I'm going to talk about what it is that

[00:02:38] **Speaker**: we do and what we've done um and what we

[00:02:41] **Speaker**: hope to keep evolving and continue

[00:02:44] **Speaker**: with so uh this is an animation uh to

[00:02:49] **Speaker**: demonstrate property of of an equation

[00:02:52] **Speaker**: that was developed by

[00:02:54] **Speaker**: Marco um when he he discovered and he

[00:02:56] **Speaker**: was about 16 or 17 I believe he's 58

[00:03:00] **Speaker**: now um so

[00:03:04] **Speaker**: he

[00:03:05] **Speaker**: decrypted this is a little obscure so I

[00:03:08] **Speaker**: hope you don't mind but I I like to to

[00:03:10] **Speaker**: go to the Obscure too as well as the

[00:03:12] **Speaker**: concrete because they're all

[00:03:14] **Speaker**: interrelated he decrypted What's called

[00:03:16] **Speaker**: the most great name of God and the bahay

[00:03:19] **Speaker**: faith which he is a member of and I

[00:03:23] **Speaker**: actually intersected with his work

[00:03:24] **Speaker**: because of my interest in linguistics

[00:03:27] **Speaker**: and my interest in the in the

[00:03:28] **Speaker**: mathematics of language and so Marco had

[00:03:32] **Speaker**: that same interest as a as a a young man

[00:03:35] **Speaker**: and he decrypted the equation for this

[00:03:38] **Speaker**: name which is said in no uncertain terms

[00:03:41] **Speaker**: if you ever read the writings of bahala

[00:03:43] **Speaker**: who is who is the prophet of that faith

[00:03:46] **Speaker**: and in no UNC terms he he says that if

[00:03:49] **Speaker**: you understand this word if you
understand the mathematics of this word 
[00:03:53] **Speaker**: that it will give you the secret to

[00:03:54] **Speaker**: every science that uh it will give you

[00:03:57] **Speaker**: the secret to an energy

[00:04:00] **Speaker**: with which and this was in the early

[00:04:02] **Speaker**: 1800s when he was saying this he said uh

[00:04:06] **Speaker**: you can tap into an energy that requires

[00:04:08] **Speaker**: no fuel and produces no

[00:04:10] **Speaker**: fumes um and essentially Marco came up

[00:04:15] **Speaker**: with this equation because he wanted to

[00:04:16] **Speaker**: figure out how to pronounce the name

[00:04:19] **Speaker**: correctly how to actually intonate and

[00:04:21] **Speaker**: say the name and his reason for being

[00:04:23] **Speaker**: interested in that is because he

[00:04:25] **Speaker**: believed that it's actually the sounds

[00:04:27] **Speaker**: the language that we speak and the the

[00:04:29] **Speaker**: sounds that we make that create our

[00:04:32] **Speaker**: intelligence and so he believed that

[00:04:35] **Speaker**: this making the sound in the correct way

[00:04:37] **Speaker**: would be the secret of intelligence and

[00:04:39] **Speaker**: it would give him the answers to

[00:04:42] **Speaker**: understanding uh the the secret hidden

[00:04:46] **Speaker**: protected energy of of the

[00:04:48] **Speaker**: universe and so he developed this

[00:04:50] **Speaker**: equation now let me go forward past the

[00:04:52] **Speaker**: animation a little bit here you can see

[00:04:54] **Speaker**: it with the numbers now this word if you
add all the numbers together the 
[00:04:58] **Speaker**: equation for the word is

[00:05:00] **Speaker**: 1251 I'm going to say a lot of things

[00:05:02] **Speaker**: today that you're not going to retain

[00:05:03] **Speaker**: and it's okay don't try to understand it

[00:05:06] **Speaker**: cuz that'll make it harder you just

[00:05:07] **Speaker**: listen to it and then of course we're
taping all this so you can go back over 
[00:05:11] **Speaker**: it but I'm going to talk a little fast

[00:05:12] **Speaker**: because the time is limited normally I

[00:05:15] **Speaker**: go in and try to explain the math I'm

[00:05:16] **Speaker**: not going to do much of that today

[00:05:19] **Speaker**: because it's uh just gets a little

[00:05:21] **Speaker**: complex but you can see the simple

[00:05:23] **Speaker**: aspect like many of our great

[00:05:25] **Speaker**: mathematical equations over the ages

[00:05:28] **Speaker**: this is simply a cross-section of a

[00:05:30] **Speaker**: circle like Pi or or many others it has

[00:05:34] **Speaker**: nine points on it because 1 2 5 one if

[00:05:36] **Speaker**: you add them together they equal nine

[00:05:38] **Speaker**: and it was said that nine was what

[00:05:41] **Speaker**: represented this energy so Marco put

[00:05:44] **Speaker**: nine at the top and he drew the numbers

[00:05:46] **Speaker**: around a circle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 right

[00:05:49] **Speaker**: according to the right hand rule and he

[00:05:52] **Speaker**: knew because of the way the equation was

[00:05:54] **Speaker**: I won't go into the linguistic argument

[00:05:56] **Speaker**: for why this is but he knew that the two

[00:05:59] **Speaker**: and the five were connected to the one

[00:06:01] **Speaker**: so what he did is he drew a line from

[00:06:02] **Speaker**: the one to the two and from the one to

[00:06:04] **Speaker**: the five and every other line that you

[00:06:07] **Speaker**: see here is simply a parallel line to

[00:06:10] **Speaker**: one of those lines if you take that line

[00:06:11] **Speaker**: from 1 to two you got 9 to 3 8 to 4 7 to

[00:06:15] **Speaker**: 5 and then you end on six if you take

[00:06:17] **Speaker**: the line from 1 to 5 you have 8 to 7 9

[00:06:20] **Speaker**: to six of course the 1 to 5 2 to four

[00:06:22] **Speaker**: and you end on three so all this is is

[00:06:24] **Speaker**: simply two sets of parallel lines okay

[00:06:28] **Speaker**: and when when you see it immediately you

[00:06:31] **Speaker**: realize well even without the coloring

[00:06:34] **Speaker**: which has been added in you realize that

[00:06:37] **Speaker**: there's there's two separate

[00:06:38] **Speaker**: intersecting systems here one is this

[00:06:43] **Speaker**: what they call the lazy 8 or the

[00:06:44] **Speaker**: infinity symbol or you could call it the

[00:06:46] **Speaker**: VW right everybody's familiar with that

[00:06:50] **Speaker**: a lot of hippies here I know um uh so uh

[00:06:56] **Speaker**: that circuit is essentially it's a

[00:06:59] **Speaker**: waveform that's what it is it's modeling

[00:07:02] **Speaker**: a closed loop it has no beginning or end

[00:07:05] **Speaker**: it you could start it anywhere and ended

[00:07:07] **Speaker**: anywhere but it's simply a closed loop

[00:07:10] **Speaker**: it's continuous and what that uh what we

[00:07:13] **Speaker**: came to learn about that many many years

[00:07:16] **Speaker**: later is that this sequence of numbers

[00:07:20] **Speaker**: represents the physical world of matter

[00:07:23] **Speaker**: in motion 3D space okay U somebody asked

[00:07:28] **Speaker**: me the other day well what is matter

[00:07:30] **Speaker**: what is

[00:07:31] **Speaker**: mass and we could go into lots of

[00:07:33] **Speaker**: different thoughts about that but

[00:07:35] **Speaker**: essentially it's a boundary condition

[00:07:37] **Speaker**: okay it's a dividing line between one

[00:07:39] **Speaker**: thing and another and it always has a

[00:07:42] **Speaker**: center which is what this is and this is

[00:07:44] **Speaker**: the zero point right here but we'll come

[00:07:46] **Speaker**: back to that so if you follow this

[00:07:48] **Speaker**: sequence just to give you a little brief

[00:07:50] **Speaker**: on the math it makes a doubling pattern

[00:07:52] **Speaker**: one doubled is two two doubled is four

[00:07:54] **Speaker**: four doubled is eight eight doubled well

[00:07:57] **Speaker**: that's not seven but eight doubled is 16

[00:07:59] **Speaker**: so do we have seven well we're simply

[00:08:01] **Speaker**: doing the age-old numerological or if

[00:08:03] **Speaker**: you want to be techno about it you can

[00:08:05] **Speaker**: call it digital root math or decimal

[00:08:07] **Speaker**: parity or whatever um if you want to be

[00:08:10] **Speaker**: a new age you can call it numerology uh

[00:08:13] **Speaker**: you add the numbers together it's called

[00:08:15] **Speaker**: cross addition 6 and one is 7even right

[00:08:18] **Speaker**: 16 doubled is 32 3 + 2 is 5 32 doubled

[00:08:22] **Speaker**: then is 64 6 and 4 is 10 and 1 and Zer

[00:08:24] **Speaker**: is 1 I'm just going to say this quickly

[00:08:27] **Speaker**: 64 128 which comes back to equal 2 256

[00:08:31] **Speaker**: which equal 4 512 which equal 8 in other

[00:08:34] **Speaker**: words you can do that forever and it

[00:08:37] **Speaker**: will never break that pattern 124875 1

[00:08:40] **Speaker**: 124875 means the doubling which

[00:08:43] **Speaker**: underlies so many uh process not only in

[00:08:46] **Speaker**: in mathematics but in physics chain

[00:08:48] **Speaker**: reactions our our our cells double at

[00:08:52] **Speaker**: conception which is how we've all come

[00:08:54] **Speaker**: to be here so it doesn't really get any

[00:08:56] **Speaker**: more intimate or personal than that

[00:08:58] **Speaker**: every single one of you you came here

[00:09:00] **Speaker**: today through a doubling process okay

[00:09:03] **Speaker**: interestingly though you could say well
is it doubling or is it halfing I don't 
[00:09:06] **Speaker**: know is it dividing is it multiplying

[00:09:08] **Speaker**: the truth is all the functions of math

[00:09:10] **Speaker**: are really one and the same I'll give

[00:09:11] **Speaker**: you an example if you take if you start

[00:09:14] **Speaker**: with the one half of one is 0.5 right

[00:09:16] **Speaker**: half of 05 is 0.25 which equals 7 half

[00:09:19] **Speaker**: of 025 is 0.125 which equals 8 Etc you

[00:09:23] **Speaker**: can do that forever and it will never

[00:09:25] **Speaker**: stop because it's all one and the same

[00:09:27] **Speaker**: it's a closed loop circuit it's because

[00:09:30] **Speaker**: Infinity in our physical world of mass

[00:09:33] **Speaker**: is not in a straight line okay neither

[00:09:36] **Speaker**: time nor space or anything in the

[00:09:37] **Speaker**: physical world moves in a straight line

[00:09:40] **Speaker**: it's all warp and a curve right and this

[00:09:43] **Speaker**: intersects with a lot of other theories

[00:09:44] **Speaker**: like relativity and people may have

[00:09:46] **Speaker**: their different thoughts about that but

[00:09:48] **Speaker**: essentially this is defining a pathway

[00:09:51] **Speaker**: for matter and motion the path of least

[00:09:53] **Speaker**: resistance and numerically that's

[00:09:55] **Speaker**: defined by doubling okay so that's one

[00:09:58] **Speaker**: aspect of what this equation is it's

[00:10:00] **Speaker**: defining a doubling sequence now then we
have this 
[00:10:04] **Speaker**: 396 what's the

[00:10:06] **Speaker**: 396 well if you look into studying

[00:10:10] **Speaker**: physics you know there's really only two

[00:10:12] **Speaker**: things you can study right if you look

[00:10:14] **Speaker**: up the definition of physics it's

[00:10:16] **Speaker**: defined as the study of matter and

[00:10:17] **Speaker**: motion of course then what is putting

[00:10:19] **Speaker**: matter in motion what what is causing

[00:10:21] **Speaker**: the matter to move what is the source of

[00:10:23] **Speaker**: time motion and vibration and that's

[00:10:26] **Speaker**: where you get to the number nine okay
but before before I go to the number 
[00:10:30] **Speaker**: nine I want to talk about three and six

[00:10:31] **Speaker**: what are three and six okay three and

[00:10:34] **Speaker**: six represent the absolute extremes they

[00:10:37] **Speaker**: end in the middle of nowhere and as an

[00:10:39] **Speaker**: engineer friend of our says nothing

[00:10:40] **Speaker**: mechanical does that okay everything

[00:10:43] **Speaker**: mechanical connects to something else uh

[00:10:46] **Speaker**: nothing mechanical ends in the middle of

[00:10:47] **Speaker**: nowhere the three and the six do that

[00:10:50] **Speaker**: interestingly three doubled if you

[00:10:52] **Speaker**: double three uh following the same

[00:10:53] **Speaker**: process is six six doubl is 12 2 and 1

[00:10:56] **Speaker**: is three 12 double is 24 which equals 6

[00:10:59] **Speaker**: 24 doubled is 48 which equals three

[00:11:01] **Speaker**: right they oscillate back and forth now

[00:11:05] **Speaker**: the only thing that we know that

[00:11:06] **Speaker**: oscillates is magnetism and that is

[00:11:09] **Speaker**: really essentially what this is defining

[00:11:11] **Speaker**: the other aspect of physics other than

[00:11:13] **Speaker**: matter and motion are what we call

[00:11:15] **Speaker**: fields which are a lot more mysterious

[00:11:17] **Speaker**: you know they have these properties like

[00:11:19] **Speaker**: non-locality perhaps um they they seem

[00:11:23] **Speaker**: to in many ways defy a lot of the

[00:11:26] **Speaker**: boundaries we've set around what matters

[00:11:29] **Speaker**: can actually do Fields seem to be um to

[00:11:33] **Speaker**: have different properties and so and the

[00:11:37] **Speaker**: nine what the nine is is a flux we call

[00:11:40] **Speaker**: it the etheron okay we've uh postulated

[00:11:44] **Speaker**: that as an ultimate fundamental particle

[00:11:46] **Speaker**: called the etheron why do we call it the

[00:11:48] **Speaker**: etheron well traditionally you know up

[00:11:51] **Speaker**: until the mikkelson Morley experiment

[00:11:53] **Speaker**: which many people can test anyway where

[00:11:56] **Speaker**: they tried to measure the drag of the
earth through space and they found there 
[00:11:59] **Speaker**: was was no resistance so they said well

[00:12:00] **Speaker**: there's no need to postulate an ether

[00:12:02] **Speaker**: all our grandparents and

[00:12:04] **Speaker**: great-grandparents and and so on and so

[00:12:06] **Speaker**: forth they all believed in what they

[00:12:07] **Speaker**: called The lumious Ether which was

[00:12:09] **Speaker**: supposed to be this substrate of energy

[00:12:11] **Speaker**: distributed throughout the Universe some
people are referred to it as a 
[00:12:14] **Speaker**: loquacious

[00:12:16] **Speaker**: Jello which I don't know what that means

[00:12:18] **Speaker**: really but uh anyway uh a loquacious

[00:12:20] **Speaker**: Jello well it's not a Jello it's not a

[00:12:22] **Speaker**: media what it is it's a pulse it's a

[00:12:25] **Speaker**: surge moves from the center of mass

[00:12:27] **Speaker**: outwards in all directions

[00:12:30] **Speaker**: and it is characterized by the fact that

[00:12:32] **Speaker**: it's linear and if you look at this

[00:12:34] **Speaker**: pyramid shape this triangle that's what

[00:12:36] **Speaker**: it is it's a vector okay it is it is the

[00:12:41] **Speaker**: linear geom geometric structure which is

[00:12:44] **Speaker**: underline the warp and curve of space

[00:12:48] **Speaker**: and time which is not linear as I said

[00:12:51] **Speaker**: before so it is not a static or

[00:12:54] **Speaker**: stationary ether it's a pulse it sets

[00:12:57] **Speaker**: the pace for everything else and it is

[00:12:59] **Speaker**: the fastest thing in the universe very

[00:13:02] **Speaker**: similar to a lot of descriptions that

[00:13:03] **Speaker**: were given this morning um by the

[00:13:05] **Speaker**: gentleman who is who was talking here

[00:13:07] **Speaker**: about uh neutral magnetic fields same

[00:13:10] **Speaker**: thing it penetrates everything nothing

[00:13:13] **Speaker**: can resist it um and there's so many

[00:13:17] **Speaker**: things it has every attribute that you

[00:13:19] **Speaker**: can imagine and the interesting thing

[00:13:22] **Speaker**: about the number nine is no matter what

[00:13:23] **Speaker**: you do to it if you multiply the number

[00:13:25] **Speaker**: nine for instance 9 * 2 is 18 9 * 3 is

[00:13:29] **Speaker**: 27 all the numbers always equal nine

[00:13:32] **Speaker**: it's the never changing number nine and

[00:13:34] **Speaker**: it's the only number that has that

[00:13:36] **Speaker**: characteristic now if you happen to be a

[00:13:38] **Speaker**: mathematician you might make an argument

[00:13:40] **Speaker**: with me about different base systems and

[00:13:42] **Speaker**: if you are a mathematician we can get

[00:13:43] **Speaker**: into that after I'm not going to melt

[00:13:45] **Speaker**: everybody's head with that you know crap

[00:13:48] **Speaker**: so uh so what we're claiming is totally
opposite and reverse of everything 
[00:13:54] **Speaker**: that's taught in the University I'll

[00:13:55] **Speaker**: give you a couple examples and and if
you go to university if you study 
[00:13:59] **Speaker**: mathematics they say well base systems

[00:14:01] **Speaker**: are arbitrary You Can Count according to

[00:14:02] **Speaker**: any system you could use base 15 you

[00:14:05] **Speaker**: could use base 5 you could use base 100

[00:14:07] **Speaker**: doesn't really matter um they say we use

[00:14:10] **Speaker**: base 10 because we have 10 fingers

[00:14:12] **Speaker**: actually we don't even have 10 fingers

[00:14:14] **Speaker**: can you believe that what we have is 05

[00:14:17] **Speaker**: which is half of 100% And they're mirror

[00:14:19] **Speaker**: images based on an axis okay it's all

[00:14:22] **Speaker**: optical illusions if we had 10 fingers

[00:14:24] **Speaker**: your thumb would be on the other side or

[00:14:26] **Speaker**: on this side right but because they're

[00:14:27] **Speaker**: mirror images there that's not how you

[00:14:30] **Speaker**: actually look at it so that's a process

[00:14:33] **Speaker**: of halfing okay the number nine is

[00:14:36] **Speaker**: forming an axis it's the only thing that

[00:14:39] **Speaker**: aligns with the zero which is the hole

[00:14:41] **Speaker**: at the center of the donut as uh Daniel

[00:14:44] **Speaker**: and Erica were demonstrating before all

[00:14:47] **Speaker**: right and I'm going to get to this shape

[00:14:48] **Speaker**: and how we came to it because this is my

[00:14:50] **Speaker**: little baby okay um so Marco developed

[00:14:55] **Speaker**: this equation he started to notice a lot

[00:14:56] **Speaker**: of interesting properties about it here

[00:14:58] **Speaker**: you can see another picture of the

[00:14:59] **Speaker**: animation showing how it moves if I was

[00:15:02] **Speaker**: to go back then you can get a sense of

[00:15:04] **Speaker**: what's going on here now you've got a

[00:15:06] **Speaker**: pulse moving out expansion and

[00:15:10] **Speaker**: contraction and this here is defining in

[00:15:13] **Speaker**: two Dimensions The Vortex okay here I'm

[00:15:17] **Speaker**: not going to go over these numbers you

[00:15:19] **Speaker**: you know I've got tons of videos online
and you can look up all this stuff but 
[00:15:22] **Speaker**: essentially it's just showing how the

[00:15:23] **Speaker**: regular multiplication tables that we

[00:15:25] **Speaker**: learned as kids could be the division

[00:15:28] **Speaker**: tables as well or addition or

[00:15:30] **Speaker**: subtraction because Vortex based

[00:15:32] **Speaker**: mathematics is the unification of all

[00:15:34] **Speaker**: the functions of math we're doing every

[00:15:36] **Speaker**: function of math possible

[00:15:38] **Speaker**: instantaneously times divide plus and

[00:15:40] **Speaker**: minus okay but what you see here is that

[00:15:44] **Speaker**: everything on opposite sides of the nine

[00:15:47] **Speaker**: forms bilateral symmetry okay I'll just

[00:15:50] **Speaker**: say one example if you do multiples of

[00:15:52] **Speaker**: one it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of course

[00:15:54] **Speaker**: 10 reduces to 1 11 to 2 12 to 3 and so

[00:15:57] **Speaker**: on now you say Eight's not a mirror of

[00:16:00] **Speaker**: one well we do notice that 1 and 8 equal

[00:16:02] **Speaker**: 9 if you add them together as well as 2

[00:16:03] **Speaker**: and 7 four and five always equal 9 as

[00:16:06] **Speaker**: well as three and six okay um eight if

[00:16:11] **Speaker**: one is going up in multiples of one that

[00:16:12] **Speaker**: means Eight's going to go down in in in

[00:16:15] **Speaker**: groups of one so 8 * 2 is 16 6 and 1 is

[00:16:18] **Speaker**: 7 8 * 3 is 24 which equal 6 32 which

[00:16:21] **Speaker**: equal 5 40 which is 4 and so on that

[00:16:24] **Speaker**: works for every multiplication series

[00:16:27] **Speaker**: that's because numbers are not flat

[00:16:30] **Speaker**: they're not dead they're not inert

[00:16:33] **Speaker**: numbers are real so when you go to

[00:16:35] **Speaker**: school and they teach you that Bas

[00:16:36] **Speaker**: systems are arbitrary or that numbers

[00:16:38] **Speaker**: are arbitrary conventions made up by

[00:16:41] **Speaker**: human beings that's false we're saying

[00:16:43] **Speaker**: that numbers are real and what does that

[00:16:46] **Speaker**: mean that means that numbers aren't

[00:16:47] **Speaker**: modeling geometry numbers are geometry

[00:16:51] **Speaker**: numbers are geometric they define space

[00:16:54] **Speaker**: and time

[00:16:56] **Speaker**: literally okay so this is showing how we

[00:16:59] **Speaker**: start to get symmetry

[00:17:02] **Speaker**: okay uh I threw this in there because

[00:17:05] **Speaker**: this is a very clear example of where

[00:17:06] **Speaker**: you can see this shape this lazy Ator

[00:17:10] **Speaker**: this VW uh again doesn't get more

[00:17:12] **Speaker**: intimate than your very own DNA which

[00:17:15] **Speaker**: you'll see right pictures of DNA and

[00:17:17] **Speaker**: wrong pictures of DNA the wrong pictures

[00:17:19] **Speaker**: of DNA are perfectly symmetrical which

[00:17:22] **Speaker**: is not how it actually is it's actually

[00:17:24] **Speaker**: offset okay and you can see that shape

[00:17:26] **Speaker**: right there 1 2 4 8 7 five because this

[00:17:32] **Speaker**: is the secret of why your DNA is in a

[00:17:34] **Speaker**: double helic helical spiral and it's

[00:17:39] **Speaker**: also the secret to the missing component

[00:17:41] **Speaker**: that the geneticists haven't fully

[00:17:43] **Speaker**: identified yet though they kind of know

[00:17:45] **Speaker**: it's there which is that in this Gap

[00:17:48] **Speaker**: space here which is called the major

[00:17:50] **Speaker**: Groove in genetics is uh a flux field a

[00:17:54] **Speaker**: magnetic field and that field which they

[00:17:57] **Speaker**: do know is there their explanation is

[00:17:59] **Speaker**: that DNA is made up of phosphates which

[00:18:00] **Speaker**: have a negative electric charge and

[00:18:02] **Speaker**: Associated magnetic field but the truth

[00:18:04] **Speaker**: is that magnetic field is controlling

[00:18:07] **Speaker**: the switching the expression of the

[00:18:09] **Speaker**: genes and I believe it's a conscious

[00:18:11] **Speaker**: field okay here it gets more into the

[00:18:14] **Speaker**: quantum level of the work we've done on

[00:18:16] **Speaker**: DNA I won't go through that too much but
here is in the red is where you can see 
[00:18:20] **Speaker**: this

[00:18:21] **Speaker**: 396 and that by the way the we had no

[00:18:24] **Speaker**: idea Marco had no idea that there was a

[00:18:26] **Speaker**: magnetic field in the major groove of

[00:18:28] **Speaker**: DNA he simply predicted it

[00:18:30] **Speaker**: mathematically and he contacted the

[00:18:32] **Speaker**: experts in the field and they confirmed

[00:18:34] **Speaker**: it so um that was a successful

[00:18:36] **Speaker**: prediction made by the math this was the
next step uh that happened and I'm 
[00:18:41] **Speaker**: talking you through things that have

[00:18:42] **Speaker**: happened over many many years this is

[00:18:44] **Speaker**: where the numbers become quantizer we

[00:18:47] **Speaker**: take it to the quantum the discret level

[00:18:51] **Speaker**: and now what this is uh it's been

[00:18:53] **Speaker**: referred to by a lot of names uh Mark

[00:18:54] **Speaker**: Alex call it the mathematical

[00:18:56] **Speaker**: fingerprint of God um you know know you

[00:18:59] **Speaker**: can you can call it what you want uh but

[00:19:02] **Speaker**: essentially it is now starting to give

[00:19:06] **Speaker**: the numbers of shape I should mention

[00:19:08] **Speaker**: there are three shapes really that are

[00:19:10] **Speaker**: specifically defined in this math um and

[00:19:14] **Speaker**: they're pretty easy okay the the three

[00:19:16] **Speaker**: does anybody have a guess triangle all

[00:19:19] **Speaker**: right I gave it to you the

[00:19:22] **Speaker**: six hexagon all right if you didn't get

[00:19:25] **Speaker**: that one you're all right and the nine a
little bit more difficult but you you 
[00:19:28] **Speaker**: can see it right here between the zero

[00:19:30] **Speaker**: and the nine is a diamond okay it just

[00:19:33] **Speaker**: so happens that those are the only

[00:19:35] **Speaker**: shapes that by themselves you can fully

[00:19:37] **Speaker**: map and tile a 3D surface topology

[00:19:40] **Speaker**: without any breaks okay and and that's

[00:19:43] **Speaker**: very

[00:19:44] **Speaker**: significant so when coming up with this

[00:19:47] **Speaker**: what we call the diamond grain crystal

[00:19:49] **Speaker**: lce structure which is seen in in a lot

[00:19:52] **Speaker**: of uh natural things and I'll show you

[00:19:55] **Speaker**: some images here in a few minutes um

[00:19:58] **Speaker**: this map contains every mathematical

[00:20:03] **Speaker**: function possible now I said function

[00:20:07] **Speaker**: and this is another place where vbm or

[00:20:10] **Speaker**: Vortex based mathematics I'll say vbm

[00:20:12] **Speaker**: from now on you know what it is um this

[00:20:15] **Speaker**: is a place another place where vbm is a

[00:20:17] **Speaker**: total 180 mirror image of conventional

[00:20:20] **Speaker**: mathematics because in conventional

[00:20:22] **Speaker**: mathematics you have functions the

[00:20:24] **Speaker**: functions are held still they're the

[00:20:26] **Speaker**: placeholders right and the number

[00:20:28] **Speaker**: numbers move they change the truth is

[00:20:31] **Speaker**: numbers don't ever change they're fixed

[00:20:33] **Speaker**: and they're fixed in relationship to one

[00:20:36] **Speaker**: another they are what we call stationary

[00:20:38] **Speaker**: Vector interstices which is just a real

[00:20:41] **Speaker**: nerdy way of saying that they're noal

[00:20:43] **Speaker**: points because every wave has to have a

[00:20:45] **Speaker**: point where it stops going up and starts

[00:20:47] **Speaker**: going down or stops going left and

[00:20:48] **Speaker**: starts going right for in order for

[00:20:50] **Speaker**: something to curve there have to be

[00:20:52] **Speaker**: those noal points there and that is

[00:20:54] **Speaker**: essentially what the numbers are

[00:20:55] **Speaker**: defining if you look at that equation at

[00:20:57] **Speaker**: each noal point is a number the numbers

[00:21:01] **Speaker**: are still and the functions move through

[00:21:03] **Speaker**: the numbers okay which is actually more

[00:21:06] **Speaker**: what a function is it's a movement it's

[00:21:07] **Speaker**: an activity and so you can actually

[00:21:11] **Speaker**: model every principle of physics every

[00:21:13] **Speaker**: type of waveform can be done here and

[00:21:16] **Speaker**: what this is showing is that it's a

[00:21:18] **Speaker**: positive and negative dual coordinate

[00:21:21] **Speaker**: system um which means that on every axis

[00:21:25] **Speaker**: X Y and Z even though you can't see the

[00:21:27] **Speaker**: z- axis

[00:21:29] **Speaker**: here you can see the xaxis vertical you

[00:21:31] **Speaker**: can see the Y AIS horizontal okay they

[00:21:34] **Speaker**: each are defined by a different

[00:21:35] **Speaker**: multiplication series and you can always

[00:21:37] **Speaker**: see that you have doubling at an angle

[00:21:40] **Speaker**: flowing at an angle which is how things

[00:21:42] **Speaker**: move at an angle nothing moves perfectly

[00:21:44] **Speaker**: left or right up or down everything

[00:21:47] **Speaker**: moves at an angle along that pathway of

[00:21:51] **Speaker**: positive to negative positive negative

[00:21:52] **Speaker**: positive and negative okay um the z-axis

[00:21:57] **Speaker**: the reason that you can't see here is

[00:21:59] **Speaker**: because it's coming from the inside

[00:22:01] **Speaker**: out this etheron energy moves from the

[00:22:04] **Speaker**: center of mass doesn't matter if it's an

[00:22:06] **Speaker**: atom or or a Galaxy or the whole

[00:22:09] **Speaker**: universe itself which I believe is in

[00:22:11] **Speaker**: the shape of a Taurus which is what

[00:22:13] **Speaker**: we're going to get to next it moves from

[00:22:15] **Speaker**: the center of mass out in all directions

[00:22:18] **Speaker**: linearly as I said before and so you

[00:22:22] **Speaker**: you're you're not seeing it as an X or Y

[00:22:26] **Speaker**: AIS and it took I I guess over 30 years

[00:22:30] **Speaker**: before I really came along and and

[00:22:32] **Speaker**: actually figured out how

[00:22:33] **Speaker**: to calculate this in a 3D to take it out

[00:22:36] **Speaker**: of this but when you do it you get this

[00:22:39] **Speaker**: shape and this is my baby girl that I

[00:22:42] **Speaker**: love so much and she's very beautiful um

[00:22:46] **Speaker**: because here we're now warping the

[00:22:49] **Speaker**: axises to be

[00:22:51] **Speaker**: circular and this is the first

[00:22:54] **Speaker**: mathematics okay I'll give you a place

[00:22:56] **Speaker**: why this is significant

[00:22:58] **Speaker**: uh for instance there's uh something

[00:23:00] **Speaker**: postulated in physics called black holes

[00:23:02] **Speaker**: you all familiar with that um which is

[00:23:04] **Speaker**: postulated being infinitely dense they
don't even know what it is because it 
[00:23:07] **Speaker**: doesn't even make any sense what is

[00:23:09] **Speaker**: infinite density um and there's so much

[00:23:11] **Speaker**: debate about it and you can read endless

[00:23:14] **Speaker**: uh Hey books about it but um the reason

[00:23:17] **Speaker**: is the reason that uh the black Hol is
thought to be infinite and they don't really know what's happening to the 
[00:23:24] **Speaker**: information or to the matter know

[00:23:26] **Speaker**: Stephen Hawking and uh what's susin had

[00:23:29] **Speaker**: a big famous debate about what happens

[00:23:31] **Speaker**: to the information well the truth is

[00:23:33] **Speaker**: what happens is it comes out the other

[00:23:35] **Speaker**: side because calculus is unable to go

[00:23:38] **Speaker**: through the center of the dut and invert

[00:23:41] **Speaker**: on its axis and come out the other side

[00:23:44] **Speaker**: it's unable to do that it self-destructs

[00:23:46] **Speaker**: it just goes to Infinity but BBM is the

[00:23:49] **Speaker**: first mathematics that's been able to do

[00:23:51] **Speaker**: that to actually model a full 3d that

[00:23:55] **Speaker**: can implode at the top as we were

[00:23:58] **Speaker**: referring to in the last talk about the

[00:24:00] **Speaker**: magnetic fields collapsing at the top

[00:24:02] **Speaker**: and to explode at the bottom so if the

[00:24:05] **Speaker**: Big Bang is in fact true it would just

[00:24:07] **Speaker**: simply be one of these explosions coming

[00:24:10] **Speaker**: out the bottom when it comes out the

[00:24:12] **Speaker**: bottom it expands and cools off which is

[00:24:15] **Speaker**: what's happening in the universe right

[00:24:17] **Speaker**: now as we are perceiving it because I

[00:24:19] **Speaker**: believe we're on the southern half of

[00:24:20] **Speaker**: the universe eventually it will warp up

[00:24:24] **Speaker**: because it is displaced moved by this

[00:24:26] **Speaker**: etheron energy by the magnetic fields

[00:24:29] **Speaker**: and cooled off and then eventually it

[00:24:31] **Speaker**: will collapse in at the top it will be

[00:24:33] **Speaker**: accelerated it will be heated and

[00:24:36] **Speaker**: eventually it will be condensed to an

[00:24:39] **Speaker**: extreme density now when we talk about

[00:24:43] **Speaker**: all all of these devices tapping in all

[00:24:45] **Speaker**: this energy we're always referring to

[00:24:47] **Speaker**: sound and I got into this because of my

[00:24:49] **Speaker**: interest in sound and because I'm a

[00:24:51] **Speaker**: musician and and many of us are and

[00:24:54] **Speaker**: because I knew that sound was really

[00:24:56] **Speaker**: behind uh the

[00:24:58] **Speaker**: GE geometry of nature it was the force

[00:25:01] **Speaker**: that's that's symmetrizing everything

[00:25:03] **Speaker**: now conventionally it's taught that the

[00:25:05] **Speaker**: fastest thing traveling in the universe

[00:25:07] **Speaker**: is light through the vacuum of space um

[00:25:11] **Speaker**: and what I believe is actually when you

[00:25:13] **Speaker**: go and and and some other scientists

[00:25:15] **Speaker**: have postulated this as well um when you

[00:25:18] **Speaker**: go into the density exotic density of

[00:25:21] **Speaker**: matter where it's being compressed to

[00:25:22] **Speaker**: the point that the escape velocity of

[00:25:25] **Speaker**: light is no longer fast enough to escape

[00:25:27] **Speaker**: that matter which is why it's called a

[00:25:29] **Speaker**: black hole that sound which has the

[00:25:32] **Speaker**: complete opposite property right light

[00:25:34] **Speaker**: slows down in media uh sound travels

[00:25:37] **Speaker**: faster the more dense the media is so

[00:25:40] **Speaker**: sound penetrating matter near the core

[00:25:42] **Speaker**: of a black hole I believe is actually

[00:25:45] **Speaker**: transcending the speed of light and it

[00:25:47] **Speaker**: creates what's called a quasi particle

[00:25:49] **Speaker**: is what they refer to it in quantum

[00:25:51] **Speaker**: mechanics as a quasi Mass particle I

[00:25:54] **Speaker**: believe is how they refer to it uh some

[00:25:56] **Speaker**: people call it hypers sound all right

[00:25:58] **Speaker**: and that is where that energy is emitted

[00:26:01] **Speaker**: from it's literally rung out of the

[00:26:03] **Speaker**: matter like squeezing juice out of an

[00:26:06] **Speaker**: orange okay um and and then it

[00:26:09] **Speaker**: redistributes itself it reanimates

[00:26:11] **Speaker**: everything it re enlivens recreates okay

[00:26:14] **Speaker**: it is the

[00:26:16] **Speaker**: anti-entropic force it is the organizing

[00:26:19] **Speaker**: principle okay here's some more pictures

[00:26:21] **Speaker**: of this Taurus uh you wouldn't believe I

[00:26:25] **Speaker**: know it looks you wouldn't believe uh

[00:26:28] **Speaker**: what it took to to actually do this

[00:26:30] **Speaker**: because now we're so fortunate this was

[00:26:32] **Speaker**: an image done by my friend Tom Barnett

[00:26:34] **Speaker**: the last one was done by a friend of

[00:26:36] **Speaker**: mine Scott Graham I never had any of

[00:26:38] **Speaker**: these computers or anything I had to do

[00:26:40] **Speaker**: this all in my head and uh it it really

[00:26:44] **Speaker**: was kind of a a feat in the sense that

[00:26:48] **Speaker**: I'm lucky that I didn't die trying to do

[00:26:50] **Speaker**: it but uh um or my head didn't explode

[00:26:55] **Speaker**: or something uh but it

[00:26:59] **Speaker**: this is showing actually the southern

[00:27:01] **Speaker**: half which is decompressing out the

[00:27:03] **Speaker**: bottom okay so that would be your your

[00:27:06] **Speaker**: big bang here's another one you can

[00:27:09] **Speaker**: scale this up and down to Infinity which

[00:27:11] **Speaker**: is what makes it fractal numbers

[00:27:14] **Speaker**: themselves are a fractal a 3D fractal so

[00:27:18] **Speaker**: you can look at simpler versions this is

[00:27:20] **Speaker**: the most basic model right here right it

[00:27:25] **Speaker**: or you can scale it you can divide it to

[00:27:27] **Speaker**: Infinity but you never reach the zero

[00:27:30] **Speaker**: because the zero is the whole you never

[00:27:33] **Speaker**: this is why absolute zero I don't

[00:27:34] **Speaker**: believe really exists because you're

[00:27:36] **Speaker**: always decreasing in partial increments

[00:27:39] **Speaker**: from your initial hole so you can go

[00:27:41] **Speaker**: colder and colder and colder and colder

[00:27:43] **Speaker**: right but eventually and and this was

[00:27:46] **Speaker**: actually proven recently where they um

[00:27:48] **Speaker**: were showing how there was a um they

[00:27:51] **Speaker**: they thought that they went beyond

[00:27:53] **Speaker**: absolute zero and then showed that there

[00:27:55] **Speaker**: was an anti-entropic Force present I

[00:27:57] **Speaker**: don't know if anybody else read about

[00:27:59] **Speaker**: that but it was uh it was talked about

[00:28:01] **Speaker**: in in the universities and everything

[00:28:04] **Speaker**: this shape the Taurus which comes out of

[00:28:06] **Speaker**: uh that equation I believe is the

[00:28:08] **Speaker**: ultimate fundamental shape for energy

[00:28:11] **Speaker**: transformation and that's what these

[00:28:12] **Speaker**: coils are based on though we still have

[00:28:14] **Speaker**: so much to learn not only about what

[00:28:16] **Speaker**: kind of media to use in order to harness

[00:28:19] **Speaker**: this and and and copper wire is just you

[00:28:21] **Speaker**: know a a primitive first step not

[00:28:24] **Speaker**: knocking anybody's work their work is

[00:28:26] **Speaker**: absolutely excellent and uh and provide

[00:28:28] **Speaker**: so much you know most people would think

[00:28:30] **Speaker**: I was totally insane if it wasn't for

[00:28:32] **Speaker**: people like Daniel and and Erica who are

[00:28:35] **Speaker**: uh showing proof of concept that because

[00:28:38] **Speaker**: there's nothing about electrical

[00:28:39] **Speaker**: engineering that says the geometry of

[00:28:41] **Speaker**: the wire would affect the output at all

[00:28:44] **Speaker**: certainly not double it with no core and

[00:28:46] **Speaker**: and half the material you know it's

[00:28:49] **Speaker**: insane I mean what all this you know I

[00:28:52] **Speaker**: I'm not an engineer thank God but

[00:28:55] **Speaker**: uh so that energy is coming from the

[00:28:58] **Speaker**: inside out and it creates this lattice

[00:29:00] **Speaker**: structure as it penetrates the matter

[00:29:02] **Speaker**: and that creates the pathway of least

[00:29:05] **Speaker**: resistance as they said before I'll show

[00:29:07] **Speaker**: you some examples here this is actually

[00:29:10] **Speaker**: out of a medical journal it took me a

[00:29:11] **Speaker**: while to find this luckily now somebody

[00:29:13] **Speaker**: must have gotten this off me because uh

[00:29:16] **Speaker**: now if you search uh my name or like AA

[00:29:18] **Speaker**: Taurus on Google you can actually find

[00:29:20] **Speaker**: this image took me years to find it it

[00:29:22] **Speaker**: was out of a medical journal and these

[00:29:24] **Speaker**: are actually images of DNA taking the

[00:29:27] **Speaker**: shape of a taus okay so it doesn't just

[00:29:29] **Speaker**: end in the middle of nowhere um in fact

[00:29:33] **Speaker**: DNA even can warp and curve back into

[00:29:36] **Speaker**: itself and create this toal shape
because it is the way that it's 
[00:29:40] **Speaker**: transforming energy here's an image of

[00:29:42] **Speaker**: blood cells again the tural shape uh

[00:29:46] **Speaker**: this is a cavitation bubble uh where

[00:29:49] **Speaker**: they've measured uh if you read the

[00:29:50] **Speaker**: journal articles which were up on my

[00:29:52] **Speaker**: website though I don't have a website up

[00:29:54] **Speaker**: at the moment um that's extreme lack of

[00:29:56] **Speaker**: funding uh I didn't have the $7 a month

[00:29:59] **Speaker**: or whatever it costs inside that jet

[00:30:03] **Speaker**: that hole that zero point have been

[00:30:05] **Speaker**: measured up to 5,000 de CI okay which is

[00:30:08] **Speaker**: like the surface of the Sun and it's

[00:30:10] **Speaker**: cool on the

[00:30:12] **Speaker**: outside right that is the core principle

[00:30:15] **Speaker**: that unifies our problem and solution to

[00:30:18] **Speaker**: every single technology out there which

[00:30:21] **Speaker**: is temperature regulation in fact if we

[00:30:24] **Speaker**: don't have temperature regulation we die

[00:30:26] **Speaker**: very quickly okay or we burn up the same

[00:30:29] **Speaker**: thing is true for the planet the same

[00:30:31] **Speaker**: thing is true for the Galaxy for

[00:30:34] **Speaker**: everything the tus is how temperature is

[00:30:37] **Speaker**: regulated it concentrates all the heat

[00:30:39] **Speaker**: and energy into the center and then it

[00:30:41] **Speaker**: uses the magnetic fields to redistribute

[00:30:44] **Speaker**: it and cool it down okay now this is

[00:30:46] **Speaker**: something we postulated years ago and I

[00:30:48] **Speaker**: was fortunate recently that some

[00:30:50] **Speaker**: Japanese scientists confirmed this

[00:30:53] **Speaker**: because they're actually making magnetic

[00:30:54] **Speaker**: refrigerators now they claim that they

[00:30:56] **Speaker**: actually don't even know how it's

[00:30:58] **Speaker**: working but when you oscillate magnetic

[00:31:00] **Speaker**: fields uh you can you can regulate

[00:31:03] **Speaker**: temperature so that has actually uh

[00:31:05] **Speaker**: proven to be true there's one and

[00:31:08] **Speaker**: weather systems we're all familiar with

[00:31:11] **Speaker**: uh there's the Galaxy uh in the shape of

[00:31:14] **Speaker**: a

[00:31:14] **Speaker**: Taurus another one okay there's uh

[00:31:18] **Speaker**: Dolphins uh who've been observed to use

[00:31:21] **Speaker**: using their uh sonar again using the

[00:31:24] **Speaker**: sound creating these toroidal rings that

[00:31:27] **Speaker**: they they then expand and contract play

[00:31:29] **Speaker**: around with and just another place where

[00:31:31] **Speaker**: you see it in nature there's the

[00:31:33] **Speaker**: sunflower again utilizing the hexagonal

[00:31:36] **Speaker**: geometry and creating a toid okay here

[00:31:40] **Speaker**: you can see the toid where you can see

[00:31:42] **Speaker**: the numbers a little better there's so

[00:31:44] **Speaker**: many things I could say about this this

[00:31:46] **Speaker**: was done by my friend Chuck midah uh and

[00:31:51] **Speaker**: you can uh see here that there are

[00:31:53] **Speaker**: numbers overlaying the other numbers

[00:31:55] **Speaker**: demonstrating how some of these fractal

[00:31:57] **Speaker**: patterns work

[00:31:58] **Speaker**: what these numbers over the numbers are

[00:32:00] **Speaker**: actually defining uh which is the key to

[00:32:03] **Speaker**: harnessing this technology and I believe
this is the part that we really haven't 
[00:32:07] **Speaker**: and somebody was asking me about this

[00:32:08] **Speaker**: earlier this is the part that we really

[00:32:10] **Speaker**: haven't totally tapped into yet fully

[00:32:13] **Speaker**: which I call Marco originally I think

[00:32:16] **Speaker**: coined the term underpinning nested

[00:32:18] **Speaker**: vortices they're like coriolis forces

[00:32:21] **Speaker**: vortexes within vortexes uh a good

[00:32:23] **Speaker**: example are dimples on a golf ball okay

[00:32:26] **Speaker**: if anybody here rememb I don't really

[00:32:28] **Speaker**: but if you remember back in in the old

[00:32:31] **Speaker**: days when the golf balls used to be

[00:32:32] **Speaker**: smooth anybody remember that golf balls

[00:32:35] **Speaker**: didn't have dimples on them they used to

[00:32:36] **Speaker**: be smooth and then uh it was some

[00:32:39] **Speaker**: mathematician or scientist based on

[00:32:40] **Speaker**: tetrahedron thing they figured out if

[00:32:42] **Speaker**: you put these dimples in it it would

[00:32:44] **Speaker**: control the flight properties the lifts

[00:32:47] **Speaker**: of of the golf ball it would give it

[00:32:49] **Speaker**: better slice everything like that and

[00:32:52] **Speaker**: and and indeed it would accelerate it

[00:32:53] **Speaker**: and cause it to go higher and further

[00:32:56] **Speaker**: and and that is what that principle is

[00:32:59] **Speaker**: if you can tap into the under pinning

[00:33:01] **Speaker**: nested vortices they work as

[00:33:03] **Speaker**: accelerators okay and that's when you

[00:33:05] **Speaker**: can really start to tap into the etheron

[00:33:09] **Speaker**: I believe um let's see what else we got

[00:33:11] **Speaker**: here more beautiful images of this

[00:33:13] **Speaker**: Taurus I wish I had all day to really

[00:33:15] **Speaker**: explain to you the beauty and complexity

[00:33:18] **Speaker**: of what these numbers Define how you can

[00:33:20] **Speaker**: make waveforms that Ripple out and make

[00:33:23] **Speaker**: perfect calculations that come back and

[00:33:25] **Speaker**: condense either where they started or an

[00:33:28] **Speaker**: opposite symmetrical node anything like

[00:33:31] **Speaker**: Newton's Cradle is an example that you

[00:33:33] **Speaker**: can Define uh with these type of systems

[00:33:37] **Speaker**: um here's another image showing uh this

[00:33:40] **Speaker**: is one I handrew showing the underpin

[00:33:43] **Speaker**: anded bores some of them are compressing

[00:33:45] **Speaker**: some of them are decompressing and you

[00:33:47] **Speaker**: always have at the center an upright

[00:33:50] **Speaker**: vertical axis another way of defining

[00:33:53] **Speaker**: what is mass it is a frame of reference

[00:33:55] **Speaker**: if anybody is familiar with that ter

[00:33:57] **Speaker**: term it defines the space and time that

[00:34:00] **Speaker**: we're living in and and it is the really

[00:34:03] **Speaker**: the source of of Relativity and why that

[00:34:06] **Speaker**: is important for why we're here for

[00:34:08] **Speaker**: energy and ultimately uh you know one of

[00:34:12] **Speaker**: my interests big interest which is

[00:34:14] **Speaker**: travel for flight because this is the

[00:34:17] **Speaker**: secret to vertical axis propulsion okay

[00:34:21] **Speaker**: implode explode close system and it

[00:34:25] **Speaker**: harnesses the secret of the vertical

[00:34:27] **Speaker**: axis which which goes back to that

[00:34:28] **Speaker**: number nine which is at the apex of the

[00:34:30] **Speaker**: vector okay the etheron is always

[00:34:34] **Speaker**: ascending which is why we have gravity

[00:34:37] **Speaker**: it's why matter collapses in on itself

[00:34:39] **Speaker**: because it's being deflected by the

[00:34:42] **Speaker**: ascending etheron particle okay another

[00:34:46] **Speaker**: uh showing of one half of the NES bores

[00:34:50] **Speaker**: at work different uh patterns this gets

[00:34:53] **Speaker**: into a little bit more of the complex

[00:34:55] **Speaker**: side of the Bas H math uh I don't really

[00:34:58] **Speaker**: have time to Define all that for you but

[00:35:00] **Speaker**: it's showing how different what we call

[00:35:02] **Speaker**: Family number groups are interrelating

[00:35:05] **Speaker**: to form very specific geometric shapes

[00:35:07] **Speaker**: in fact Within These Tauruses you can

[00:35:10] **Speaker**: Define every single geometry that exists

[00:35:13] **Speaker**: in a whole lot that people are probably

[00:35:15] **Speaker**: unaware of um here is H one example of

[00:35:18] **Speaker**: showing uh this was again done by Tom

[00:35:20] **Speaker**: Barnett showing that uh where this

[00:35:25] **Speaker**: pathway of the z-axis these m& are

[00:35:28] **Speaker**: intersecting and it's a very it's a very

[00:35:31] **Speaker**: interesting uh point because if you can

[00:35:34] **Speaker**: see this on another tours I'll show you

[00:35:36] **Speaker**: exactly where that's been observed which

[00:35:39] **Speaker**: was in the famous uh eye of God

[00:35:41] **Speaker**: Supernova you can see that exact same

[00:35:44] **Speaker**: and along those white lines pathway and
I had no idea when we did this I mean I had no idea that it was going to come 
[00:35:49] **Speaker**: out into that shape it simply did the

[00:35:51] **Speaker**: math we created the shape and uh you can

[00:35:54] **Speaker**: see that eyeball kind of intersection at

[00:35:57] **Speaker**: the middle okay those are actually the

[00:36:00] **Speaker**: end of my slides um I didn't I I really

[00:36:03] **Speaker**: condensed this down because I knew we

[00:36:04] **Speaker**: were at limited time and I wanted to

[00:36:07] **Speaker**: introduce these Concepts ultimately I

[00:36:10] **Speaker**: believe that if the etheron is

[00:36:12] **Speaker**: understood tapped into I'm very

[00:36:14] **Speaker**: interested in transforming these like uh

[00:36:16] **Speaker**: plasma coils uh a little more higher-end

[00:36:19] **Speaker**: technology if if the funding becomes

[00:36:22] **Speaker**: available uh I believe that it you can

[00:36:25] **Speaker**: tap into literally Limitless

[00:36:29] **Speaker**: inexhaustible energy that is is truly

[00:36:32] **Speaker**: free is truly um at the source of of

[00:36:37] **Speaker**: even free free will itself

[00:36:39] **Speaker**: self-determination a self-enclosed frame

[00:36:42] **Speaker**: of reference this is essentially the

[00:36:45] **Speaker**: explanation as far as I'm concerned of

[00:36:47] **Speaker**: what the famous Flying Saucer is why it

[00:36:51] **Speaker**: is in this shape and why it moves like

[00:36:52] **Speaker**: it does and understanding those nested

[00:36:55] **Speaker**: vortices is the key to how to steer it

[00:36:58] **Speaker**: how to move it okay so um I think I'll

[00:37:03] **Speaker**: stop there and let people ask questions

[00:37:05] **Speaker**: and then we can just sort of see where

[00:37:07] **Speaker**: it goes

[00:37:09] **Speaker**: sure you mention that numbers are

[00:37:12] **Speaker**: AA could you explain more about that

[00:37:14] **Speaker**: concept sure so you know we we learn

[00:37:18] **Speaker**: about numbers traditionally in

[00:37:19] **Speaker**: multiplication series as if they exist

[00:37:22] **Speaker**: in in an abstract realm we learn about

[00:37:24] **Speaker**: three apples and two oranges and and all

[00:37:27] **Speaker**: that

[00:37:28] **Speaker**: that is the uh what is called numbers as

[00:37:31] **Speaker**: quantity okay and and and many people

[00:37:33] **Speaker**: talk about quantity versus quality in

[00:37:35] **Speaker**: all aspects of life well numbers are the

[00:37:37] **Speaker**: same way they do have quantities but the

[00:37:40] **Speaker**: quantities of numbers as they express

[00:37:43] **Speaker**: themselves are a an expression or a

[00:37:46] **Speaker**: result of the qualities of numbers so

[00:37:48] **Speaker**: the quantitative

[00:37:50] **Speaker**: doubling within a system is an

[00:37:52] **Speaker**: expression of the qualitative doubling

[00:37:54] **Speaker**: and that means that quantitatively as a

[00:37:57] **Speaker**: sublink it's actually moving as well

[00:38:00] **Speaker**: it's actually creating geometric lce

[00:38:03] **Speaker**: structures um and so you can't separate

[00:38:06] **Speaker**: mathematics from 3D space there's lots

[00:38:08] **Speaker**: of different theories in mathematics you

[00:38:09] **Speaker**: can read about String Theory uh you know

[00:38:12] **Speaker**: I did this Ted Talk where um you know I

[00:38:15] **Speaker**: was after some years kind of sparked

[00:38:17] **Speaker**: this censorship mode of of Ted that

[00:38:20] **Speaker**: they've gone into uh I I like to were

[00:38:23] **Speaker**: you the first I as far as I know myself

[00:38:25] **Speaker**: and uh there was an economist who was

[00:38:27] **Speaker**: answered by them uh yeah and we were the

[00:38:30] **Speaker**: first two that I think got it so so I

[00:38:33] **Speaker**: was I was excited you know I love

[00:38:35] **Speaker**: confrontation I'm totally all about it

[00:38:38] **Speaker**: so I I went and I said all right this is

[00:38:40] **Speaker**: great I said let's have a debate I got I
got them to bring all their people we 
[00:38:44] **Speaker**: got this huge conference call with all

[00:38:45] **Speaker**: the head people from Ted and and there

[00:38:47] **Speaker**: was all these witnesses there who

[00:38:49] **Speaker**: organized the Ted that I spoke at and

[00:38:52] **Speaker**: man they had nothing they couldn't

[00:38:54] **Speaker**: answer a single question and they they

[00:38:56] **Speaker**: had no reason for censoring why I bring

[00:38:58] **Speaker**: this up is because one so one of the

[00:38:59] **Speaker**: things they said they said well we can't

[00:39:01] **Speaker**: put this out there because there's no

[00:39:02] **Speaker**: empirical evidence to support it well I

[00:39:05] **Speaker**: said actually indeed there is and now I

[00:39:07] **Speaker**: even have confirmations from

[00:39:08] **Speaker**: universities in Europe who are putting

[00:39:10] **Speaker**: together now a technical manual for us

[00:39:13] **Speaker**: to show that these even these simple

[00:39:15] **Speaker**: primitive devices are drawing energy

[00:39:18] **Speaker**: from an unknown unexplainable source

[00:39:20] **Speaker**: that can't there's no explanation for

[00:39:21] **Speaker**: where it's coming from they're also able

[00:39:23] **Speaker**: to do things like produce rare noble

[00:39:25] **Speaker**: gases at extremely low voltage is which

[00:39:27] **Speaker**: is according to them very unheard of um

[00:39:30] **Speaker**: things like Argon gas um the uh so I
said well there is actually empirical evidence but I'm okay with that but I 
[00:39:37] **Speaker**: said if if that's the reason you're

[00:39:38] **Speaker**: censoring me then you need to take down

[00:39:41] **Speaker**: like for example Brian Green's talk on

[00:39:42] **Speaker**: string theory because not only is there

[00:39:45] **Speaker**: no empirical evidence there's not even

[00:39:46] **Speaker**: any way to even get at how you would

[00:39:48] **Speaker**: figure out how to test

[00:39:51] **Speaker**: that well they said well but he's famous

[00:39:54] **Speaker**: you know and I well so you know he's

[00:39:57] **Speaker**: well he teaches at a university I said

[00:39:59] **Speaker**: well so is that what it is I'm not

[00:40:00] **Speaker**: famous enough to say this you know um

[00:40:03] **Speaker**: and that was just one of about 100

[00:40:05] **Speaker**: points and and I'm I'm very proud of the

[00:40:07] **Speaker**: fact that some of my friends uh quit and

[00:40:09] **Speaker**: left that organization over the um

[00:40:12] **Speaker**: complete humiliation that was

[00:40:14] **Speaker**: experienced uh by their

[00:40:17] **Speaker**: uh by their closed-mindedness so thank

[00:40:20] **Speaker**: you uh but um one last thing who

[00:40:23] **Speaker**: somebody somewhere had to instigate that

[00:40:25] **Speaker**: did they did that ever come out yeah it

[00:40:27] **Speaker**: was a group of science bloggers online

[00:40:30] **Speaker**: and if you read the blogs they sent me

[00:40:32] **Speaker**: the blogs I said well let me read them

[00:40:34] **Speaker**: they sent them to me there's not one

[00:40:36] **Speaker**: criticism of anything that I said it's a

[00:40:38] **Speaker**: total ad homonym that just quote me and

[00:40:40] **Speaker**: go this guy's crazy you know I was like

[00:40:43] **Speaker**: that's scientific discourse you know

[00:40:45] **Speaker**: like I mean and I told them I said let's

[00:40:47] **Speaker**: have a public debate I'm open I said

[00:40:49] **Speaker**: I'll debate anybody and Rupert sheld did

[00:40:52] **Speaker**: this too he he got censored much later

[00:40:53] **Speaker**: but you know they they won't engage yeah

[00:40:56] **Speaker**: they they won't engage on level I said

[00:40:58] **Speaker**: you know if I'm so fallacious then you

[00:41:00] **Speaker**: should expose me to the public and let's

[00:41:01] **Speaker**: just squash this once and for all but

[00:41:03] **Speaker**: they didn't they didn't they were a

[00:41:05] **Speaker**: little intimidated by that I guess um um

[00:41:14] **Speaker**: sure somebody have a microphone you can

[00:41:17] **Speaker**: give oh yeah I think there was there one

[00:41:19] **Speaker**: up here there used to be another one

[00:41:21] **Speaker**: it's coming oh here it comes here comes

[00:41:23] **Speaker**: the microphone

[00:41:29] **Speaker**: was seems like everything in the in the
material everything in the universe is 
[00:41:33] **Speaker**: spinning it's verticular like the Earth

[00:41:34] **Speaker**: is spinning the sun is spinning the

[00:41:37] **Speaker**: solar system Galaxy and who knows about

[00:41:39] **Speaker**: the universe is it spinning as well um

[00:41:42] **Speaker**: what's causing it um does every material

[00:41:44] **Speaker**: object have like an in and out like

[00:41:46] **Speaker**: energy flowing in through the ether and

[00:41:48] **Speaker**: then it's also I believe it's been

[00:41:50] **Speaker**: demonstrated that matter even that

[00:41:53] **Speaker**: matter or energy coming out of matter

[00:41:55] **Speaker**: like a like photonic energy or whatever

[00:41:57] **Speaker**: so yeah there's a there's a radiation

[00:42:00] **Speaker**: side to it and there's an yeah there's

[00:42:02] **Speaker**: an implosion and an explosion as many

[00:42:04] **Speaker**: people say at these conferences um uh

[00:42:09] **Speaker**: you know we we're good at tapping into

[00:42:11] **Speaker**: the explosion side it's a lot easier the

[00:42:13] **Speaker**: implosion side is much more difficult

[00:42:15] **Speaker**: for people to tap into or at least at

[00:42:17] **Speaker**: the approach that they're taking but the

[00:42:19] **Speaker**: truth is everything has to implode

[00:42:20] **Speaker**: before it explodes now as far as

[00:42:23] **Speaker**: rotation and spin I believe that this uh

[00:42:26] **Speaker**: what we call these flux Fields flux

[00:42:28] **Speaker**: magnetic fields are at the source of as

[00:42:31] **Speaker**: I said before time motion and vibration

[00:42:34] **Speaker**: so what's happening is that the linear

[00:42:35] **Speaker**: pathway the penetration of this energy

[00:42:38] **Speaker**: is deflecting matter where this energy

[00:42:41] **Speaker**: is matter cannot be okay that's why

[00:42:43] **Speaker**: there's a hole at the center if you

[00:42:45] **Speaker**: didn't have a hole everything would be

[00:42:47] **Speaker**: log jammed things wouldn't be able to

[00:42:49] **Speaker**: move it's because things aren't really

[00:42:51] **Speaker**: based on a duality or a polarity like we

[00:42:53] **Speaker**: think it's always a trary there's always

[00:42:56] **Speaker**: three parts to the system and that three

[00:42:58] **Speaker**: is the minimum that you can have to

[00:43:00] **Speaker**: create a living Moving System what which

[00:43:04] **Speaker**: are the three well the numerically we

[00:43:08] **Speaker**: Define them by the three n and six

[00:43:10] **Speaker**: though there are other what we that's

[00:43:12] **Speaker**: how we Define what we call Family number

[00:43:13] **Speaker**: groups which I go into in a lot of my

[00:43:15] **Speaker**: work um they're 39647 and 25 and 8 uh

[00:43:19] **Speaker**: but essentially the 396 which was

[00:43:21] **Speaker**: referred to by Nicola Tesla famously he

[00:43:23] **Speaker**: said I probably misquoted a little bit

[00:43:25] **Speaker**: but something to the effect of if

[00:43:27] **Speaker**: Humanity could understand the 39 and six

[00:43:29] **Speaker**: they would understand the secrets of the

[00:43:31] **Speaker**: universe and that's indeed what we found

[00:43:33] **Speaker**: is that the 39 and six are a separate

[00:43:36] **Speaker**: system they're not a

[00:43:38] **Speaker**: physical uh they're not they don't have

[00:43:40] **Speaker**: physical mass and so they they are

[00:43:43] **Speaker**: defining what is deflecting and causing

[00:43:46] **Speaker**: everything to curve and warp back in on

[00:43:48] **Speaker**: itself and then eventually to explode

[00:43:51] **Speaker**: and expand back out the other

[00:43:56] **Speaker**: side he said an in and out in the center
yeah an in and out in Center yeah 
[00:44:00] **Speaker**: exactly you could think of it that way

[00:44:01] **Speaker**: that there's there's always that there's

[00:44:03] **Speaker**: always the the the whole the zero or the

[00:44:06] **Speaker**: nine yeah yes um okay sure um you were

[00:44:10] **Speaker**: talking about uh the importance of 36

[00:44:12] **Speaker**: and nine um just curious uh with the um

[00:44:16] **Speaker**: the idea of shearing in these Roden

[00:44:17] **Speaker**: coils where you can have uninsulated

[00:44:20] **Speaker**: copper touching themselves and the nodes

[00:44:22] **Speaker**: and anti noes are canceling out much

[00:44:23] **Speaker**: like the Nik Tesla hair pin experiment

[00:44:26] **Speaker**: he was doing with high frequencies

[00:44:28] **Speaker**: that's yeah great great point and I

[00:44:30] **Speaker**: didn't mention that uh in the talk I'll

[00:44:32] **Speaker**: show you uh some images so what we get

[00:44:36] **Speaker**: um he he asked about he he he used the

[00:44:38] **Speaker**: word shearing there's a term that's been

[00:44:41] **Speaker**: coined within vbm Marco coin it called

[00:44:44] **Speaker**: harmonic shearing okay and it's not

[00:44:47] **Speaker**: understood at all in terms of electrical

[00:44:49] **Speaker**: engineering these coils are very unique

[00:44:52] **Speaker**: because we claim you can actually have

[00:44:53] **Speaker**: two conductors side by side touching one

[00:44:56] **Speaker**: another and their resonance is so

[00:44:58] **Speaker**: perfect that they won't short out okay

[00:45:01] **Speaker**: because this thing is not all on at one

[00:45:04] **Speaker**: time okay it has a phasing it has a

[00:45:08] **Speaker**: sequencing okay so when when one circuit

[00:45:11] **Speaker**: is on flowing in the other ones are off

[00:45:14] **Speaker**: then that one is off then there's

[00:45:15] **Speaker**: another path blowing outward

[00:45:17] **Speaker**: decompressing and then they're both off

[00:45:19] **Speaker**: and that's when the flux field is active

[00:45:22] **Speaker**: what that does and

[00:45:24] **Speaker**: mathematically well I I shouldn't get

[00:45:27] **Speaker**: too far into how it works numerically

[00:45:29] **Speaker**: but what we're able to see in these

[00:45:31] **Speaker**: thick black lines here um is what we

[00:45:34] **Speaker**: call a harmonic Shear which means

[00:45:36] **Speaker**: there's always a constant value there

[00:45:38] **Speaker**: and it means that uh there's a boundary

[00:45:41] **Speaker**: condition there these underpinning

[00:45:43] **Speaker**: nested bores Shear against one another

[00:45:46] **Speaker**: it's very important when you look at

[00:45:47] **Speaker**: this image that the bores do not line up

[00:45:50] **Speaker**: they are staggered like the teeth of a

[00:45:52] **Speaker**: shark which G which is what makes it

[00:45:55] **Speaker**: grip it's what holds things together and

[00:45:57] **Speaker**: that is essentially what the etheron

[00:45:59] **Speaker**: energy is it is the glue that holds the

[00:46:02] **Speaker**: universe together and it creates these

[00:46:05] **Speaker**: World boundary condition shears and

[00:46:07] **Speaker**: those shears create extreme amounts of

[00:46:09] **Speaker**: power in a small space yes

[00:46:14] **Speaker**: siry is is there an importance to the

[00:46:17] **Speaker**: size of the hole the ratio of the hole

[00:46:19] **Speaker**: the center

[00:46:22] **Speaker**: to absolutely

[00:46:24] **Speaker**: yeah of

[00:46:28] **Speaker**: well experimentally we haven't fully

[00:46:30] **Speaker**: determined that so but I'll tell you

[00:46:32] **Speaker**: about it mathematically it's very

[00:46:34] **Speaker**: important and it's a and and you know

[00:46:36] **Speaker**: you're going to write to the advanced

[00:46:38] **Speaker**: part of the math now these are primitive

[00:46:40] **Speaker**: handdrawn handdrawn images that are not

[00:46:44] **Speaker**: precise geometrically um even the ones

[00:46:47] **Speaker**: that are out there on uh the computer

[00:46:50] **Speaker**: generated images that we have now uh

[00:46:52] **Speaker**: because you know half the guys I've been

[00:46:54] **Speaker**: working with for years here this is the

[00:46:56] **Speaker**: first time we've met in person because

[00:46:58] **Speaker**: there's no uh finding apparatus around

[00:47:01] **Speaker**: this project in that sense uh I do know

[00:47:04] **Speaker**: how to define that and it depends on it

[00:47:07] **Speaker**: depends on the type of tourist the the

[00:47:09] **Speaker**: discovery that I made showed that

[00:47:11] **Speaker**: there's an extreme amount of variation

[00:47:13] **Speaker**: in this which is what we wanted to find

[00:47:15] **Speaker**: because obviously going from a donut to

[00:47:17] **Speaker**: all of this there's a lot of variation

[00:47:20] **Speaker**: involved so really the size of that hole

[00:47:23] **Speaker**: can vary and we see that in nature you

[00:47:25] **Speaker**: can have a hole like in that cavitation

[00:47:27] **Speaker**: bubble that's roughly one10 the size of

[00:47:30] **Speaker**: the outer diameter or you can have a

[00:47:33] **Speaker**: like a black hole type system where it's

[00:47:35] **Speaker**: h you know a seep trillion or whatever a

[00:47:39] **Speaker**: tiny tiny tiny hole with a huge huge

[00:47:42] **Speaker**: outer radius and I believe that that

[00:47:44] **Speaker**: absolutely increases the power of the

[00:47:47] **Speaker**: system you know when you're talking to

[00:47:49] **Speaker**: uh the Practical people out there are

[00:47:51] **Speaker**: trying to wind coils though they're not

[00:47:53] **Speaker**: too keen on that tiny hole so um so but

[00:47:57] **Speaker**: when we get into 3D printing when we get

[00:47:58] **Speaker**: into other types of engineering that's

[00:48:01] **Speaker**: going to become easier to do and

[00:48:03] **Speaker**: ultimately I believe that is the key to

[00:48:05] **Speaker**: hot Fusion because it controls the

[00:48:07] **Speaker**: temperature it regulates it and it

[00:48:09] **Speaker**: concentrates it at the center and it

[00:48:11] **Speaker**: keeps the outside cool um probably have

[00:48:14] **Speaker**: time for one more just what are your
thoughts on 
[00:48:22] **Speaker**: Daniel

[00:48:24] **Speaker**: men on about the powder that gets

[00:48:32] **Speaker**: collected

[00:48:34] **Speaker**: yeah I I don't specifically but there

[00:48:36] **Speaker**: there's so many interesting effects that

[00:48:38] **Speaker**: we've seen out of these that you know

[00:48:40] **Speaker**: and and asan as this is and this is

[00:48:42] **Speaker**: again very basic I've gone so far into

[00:48:45] **Speaker**: this mathematically as far as prime

[00:48:47] **Speaker**: numbers and which I really wanted to

[00:48:49] **Speaker**: talk about today but there's just no

[00:48:50] **Speaker**: time for it um there there's so much

[00:48:52] **Speaker**: advanced work in the math and yet at the

[00:48:55] **Speaker**: same time we're barely even scratching

[00:48:57] **Speaker**: the surface of what we know and

[00:48:58] **Speaker**: understand about this our goal is to

[00:49:00] **Speaker**: really create a community around this I
I'll just say this one thing and I'll 
[00:49:03] **Speaker**: take uh this one last question and then

[00:49:05] **Speaker**: we'll probably have to wrap up um we are

[00:49:07] **Speaker**: uh producing a film that we're going to

[00:49:09] **Speaker**: be releasing online uh it's called ry's

[00:49:12] **Speaker**: donuts I didn't give it that name but uh

[00:49:14] **Speaker**: there's a big joke around that if if

[00:49:16] **Speaker**: you're from La you know what I'm talking

[00:49:17] **Speaker**: about yeah yeah it rolled across the

[00:49:19] **Speaker**: screen in the 2012 film and everybody

[00:49:21] **Speaker**: was real excited and then Iron Man had

[00:49:24] **Speaker**: his coil that it was messed up and I got

[00:49:27] **Speaker**: so many emails like you got to go see

[00:49:28] **Speaker**: Iron Man so I went and saw it and it

[00:49:30] **Speaker**: goes and sits in the ry's donuts and

[00:49:32] **Speaker**: everybody got a big kick out of that so

[00:49:34] **Speaker**: the film's called ry's donuts um

[00:49:36] **Speaker**: actually I believe today or tomorrow
this in the next couple days is the last days we're going to have for the 
[00:49:40] **Speaker**: crowdfunding but you guys can look that

[00:49:42] **Speaker**: up online or or check me out on Facebook

[00:49:44] **Speaker**: and and all that information is on there

[00:49:47] **Speaker**: if you're interested being a part this

[00:49:49] **Speaker**: project is like no other because we are

[00:49:51] **Speaker**: a truly open- source project we are as

[00:49:54] **Speaker**: destitute as you could possibly be I'm

[00:49:56] **Speaker**: not proud of it it just is what it is

[00:49:58] **Speaker**: but um it's because we're really

[00:50:00] **Speaker**: committed as my friend Michael here is

[00:50:03] **Speaker**: as well we were very committed to the

[00:50:06] **Speaker**: operative word which is free energy

[00:50:08] **Speaker**: we're committed to the community to the

[00:50:10] **Speaker**: sharing we're committed to doing

[00:50:12] **Speaker**: something from the heart that's true and
real and genuine because that's the only 
[00:50:15] **Speaker**: way I believe that we can all come

[00:50:17] **Speaker**: together get over all the ego junk and

[00:50:20] **Speaker**: get together and make it happen you

[00:50:23] **Speaker**: know thank

[00:50:24] **Speaker**: you I just have this one last here and

[00:50:27] **Speaker**: I'd be happy to take yours two after if

[00:50:29] **Speaker**: we're out of time okay go ahead and

[00:50:31] **Speaker**: we'll do these two and then can I get

[00:50:33] **Speaker**: time to do two okay what did you you

[00:50:35] **Speaker**: said that 3D reality is a a tri a trary

[00:50:38] **Speaker**: system and it it maps to the surface of

[00:50:40] **Speaker**: the Taurus other dimensions of time in

[00:50:42] **Speaker**: space do they also map to the surface

[00:50:45] **Speaker**: and are they also a trary or something

[00:50:47] **Speaker**: else yeah that was what I was getting to
and the the point I was making earlier about String Theory you know there's a 
[00:50:52] **Speaker**: lot of thoughts about different

[00:50:53] **Speaker**: dimensions I'm a little bit uh maybe I'm

[00:50:56] **Speaker**: old school or whatever I actually don't

[00:50:58] **Speaker**: believe in all these extra dimensions in

[00:51:00] **Speaker**: fact I don't believe that you can

[00:51:02] **Speaker**: actually logically postulate something

[00:51:03] **Speaker**: that you cannot conceive you know you

[00:51:05] **Speaker**: can postulate something that you maybe

[00:51:07] **Speaker**: haven't perceived but you can conceive

[00:51:09] **Speaker**: of it but if you can't conceive of it

[00:51:11] **Speaker**: which no one has ever conceived of five

[00:51:13] **Speaker**: Dimensions or you know they make these

[00:51:15] **Speaker**: tesseracts and things but they're all

[00:51:16] **Speaker**: threedimensional and and and the point

[00:51:18] **Speaker**: is you have 3D and the higher Dimension

[00:51:21] **Speaker**: defined by the 396 is what we call the

[00:51:23] **Speaker**: Omni Dimension but it it it it is not an

[00:51:26] **Speaker**: any way akin to you know it is a it it

[00:51:31] **Speaker**: is non-local in that sense so you have

[00:51:33] **Speaker**: 3D which is the physical reality or any

[00:51:36] **Speaker**: sort of even if it's a some some people
when they say Dimensions maybe they mean 
[00:51:39] **Speaker**: a higher frequency or something that's

[00:51:41] **Speaker**: invisible to us uh but to me that's

[00:51:43] **Speaker**: still a part of a 3D reality any sort of

[00:51:46] **Speaker**: bounded reality to me the the the three

[00:51:49] **Speaker**: and this I can get into the hardcore

[00:51:51] **Speaker**: math arguments about why this is and why

[00:51:53] **Speaker**: three is the sole unique prime number

[00:51:56] **Speaker**: that defines why we use base 10 because

[00:51:59] **Speaker**: it's the first true Prime squared which

[00:52:01] **Speaker**: is nine right modular nine math uh but

[00:52:04] **Speaker**: but essentially yes every you have 3D
which is the physical world and then you 
[00:52:07] **Speaker**: have the Omni Dimension which is the

[00:52:09] **Speaker**: energetic world and that that Omni

[00:52:11] **Speaker**: Dimension is only dimensional Lies per

[00:52:14] **Speaker**: se where it intersects with the third

[00:52:17] **Speaker**: dimension I hope that's pretty decent

[00:52:20] **Speaker**: answer TV and radio it's all in the same

[00:52:22] **Speaker**: space just different frequency bands

[00:52:24] **Speaker**: right right okay one last one uh you

[00:52:26] **Speaker**: brought up conventional plasma reactors

[00:52:29] **Speaker**: um and I'm curious about your thoughts

[00:52:31] **Speaker**: about uh the perceived enhancements that

[00:52:35] **Speaker**: uh vbm could could provide to current
reactors and the changes and your 
[00:52:40] **Speaker**: thoughts on the changes you said you're

[00:52:41] **Speaker**: not an engineer yourself uh but just to

[00:52:44] **Speaker**: complement you know some ideas that you

[00:52:45] **Speaker**: may have about enhancing current plasma

[00:52:48] **Speaker**: reactors as the Plasma's rotating in the

[00:52:50] **Speaker**: center of the Taurus inside the Taurus

[00:52:53] **Speaker**: and in current plasma reactors whereas

[00:52:55] **Speaker**: we had it seems like magic inside the

[00:52:57] **Speaker**: center of the tourus and so well it's

[00:53:00] **Speaker**: somewhat similar and obviously I'm not

[00:53:02] **Speaker**: an expert on plasma reactors for those

[00:53:04] **Speaker**: of you who don't know this isn't totally

[00:53:06] **Speaker**: an obscure idea because tal reactors are

[00:53:08] **Speaker**: all over the place I mean uh there's a

[00:53:11] **Speaker**: big huge one up at the University of

[00:53:12] **Speaker**: Wisconsin there is uh the toac all these

[00:53:15] **Speaker**: different types of toal fusion reactors

[00:53:18] **Speaker**: so this is something that mainstream

[00:53:20] **Speaker**: science is is somewhat onto and uh um

[00:53:25] **Speaker**: you know but they're doing similar to

[00:53:27] **Speaker**: how things are done in in electrical

[00:53:29] **Speaker**: engineering could make the analogy where

[00:53:30] **Speaker**: they're using magnets to push the energy

[00:53:34] **Speaker**: to push the plasma or to push the

[00:53:36] **Speaker**: electricity through the medium so in in

[00:53:38] **Speaker**: a case of a coil you're using the magnet

[00:53:40] **Speaker**: to push it through the wire and what we

[00:53:44] **Speaker**: discovered in this and what many people

[00:53:45] **Speaker**: know or uh even if you're do martial

[00:53:48] **Speaker**: arts or something pull is always

[00:53:50] **Speaker**: stronger than push no one likes to be

[00:53:52] **Speaker**: pushed you know the pulling the coercion

[00:53:55] **Speaker**: side is much stronger stronger force and

[00:53:58] **Speaker**: uh the ability to tap into that is

[00:54:00] **Speaker**: largely uh a matter of geomet geometric

[00:54:03] **Speaker**: pathway that's moved in so most of these

[00:54:05] **Speaker**: Fusion reactors they get so hot so quick

[00:54:07] **Speaker**: I mean they can only activate them for a

[00:54:09] **Speaker**: very small uh frame of time and it's

[00:54:12] **Speaker**: because they're using magnets moving

[00:54:15] **Speaker**: vertically and horizontally to excite

[00:54:17] **Speaker**: and move the plasma and that's causing

[00:54:19] **Speaker**: it to move in a way that creates a lot

[00:54:21] **Speaker**: of friction a lot of heat a lot of heat

[00:54:23] **Speaker**: loss okay if you uh can move the and I I

[00:54:28] **Speaker**: don't know how you would necessarily

[00:54:29] **Speaker**: enhance the current design but if you

[00:54:32] **Speaker**: started building building off of these

[00:54:35] **Speaker**: principles to begin with moving the

[00:54:37] **Speaker**: plasma along the pathway that it

[00:54:39] **Speaker**: actually is seeking to go naturally will

[00:54:42] **Speaker**: eliminate random collisions of particles

[00:54:44] **Speaker**: will eliminate the friction and will

[00:54:46] **Speaker**: concentrate the heat to the center and

[00:54:48] **Speaker**: then regulate the temperature and so

[00:54:51] **Speaker**: it's it's just the same essential

[00:54:52] **Speaker**: principle of how it would be used in
that uh 
[00:54:56] **Speaker**: thank you all very much I really

[00:54:58] **Speaker**: appreciate your time and attention

[00:55:03] **Speaker**: [Applause]

[00:55:08] **Speaker**: [Music]
