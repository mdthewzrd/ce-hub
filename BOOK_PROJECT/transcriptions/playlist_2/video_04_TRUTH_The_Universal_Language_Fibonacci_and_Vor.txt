[00:00:00] **Speaker**: hello everyone this is Holly Powell um I

[00:00:04] **Speaker**: just wanted to come on here and thank
everyone for 
[00:00:08] **Speaker**: um

[00:00:09] **Speaker**: accept me into this group it this has

[00:00:11] **Speaker**: been a journey that I've been on for

[00:00:14] **Speaker**: three and a half years I had a spiritual

[00:00:16] **Speaker**: awakening and I was shown two numbers in

[00:00:20] **Speaker**: the spirit and those numbers are the

[00:00:22] **Speaker**: number two and the number eight and they

[00:00:25] **Speaker**: were also brought together

[00:00:27] **Speaker**: to become a 28

[00:00:29] **Speaker**: and last but not least I think even more

[00:00:33] **Speaker**: important than ever the num

[00:00:37] **Speaker**: the number um

[00:00:39] **Speaker**: or two eights were shown as well which

[00:00:41] **Speaker**: equals 88 and I believe this is the key

[00:00:45] **Speaker**: to seeing the micro and the macrocosms

[00:00:48] **Speaker**: the above so

[00:00:52] **Speaker**: as above so below and everything that's

[00:00:56] **Speaker**: in US is reflected outside of us

[00:00:59] **Speaker**: Through the Universe

[00:01:00] **Speaker**: um so the title of this presentation is
the universal language and how it 
[00:01:05] **Speaker**: connects everything

[00:01:06] **Speaker**: today's date is December 19

[00:01:09] **Speaker**: 2015. actually December 20th because

[00:01:12] **Speaker**: definitely past 12 o'clock uh so yeah

[00:01:15] **Speaker**: I'm just gonna go ahead and get started

[00:01:17] **Speaker**: and I hope you enjoyed this presentation

[00:01:19] **Speaker**: I'm not going to go in the

[00:01:21] **Speaker**: justifications of all the vortex based

[00:01:24] **Speaker**: math and the Fibonacci because I know

[00:01:26] **Speaker**: all of you guys that are in this group

[00:01:28] **Speaker**: excuse me excuse me I already know all

[00:01:31] **Speaker**: this information so I'm just going to go

[00:01:33] **Speaker**: ahead go through this quickly and show

[00:01:35] **Speaker**: you what I have and I welcome any

[00:01:37] **Speaker**: feedback that anyone can give me

[00:01:40] **Speaker**: so what I did in Excel as I was learning

[00:01:42] **Speaker**: about Fibonacci I also stumbled upon

[00:01:45] **Speaker**: um macaron's work and Randy Powell so

[00:01:47] **Speaker**: what I did for myself in Excel was to

[00:01:51] **Speaker**: set up and playing crunch the numbers

[00:01:53] **Speaker**: myself I set it up to where I could go

[00:01:56] **Speaker**: in here and pop in this number right

[00:01:57] **Speaker**: here and all my formulas changed the

[00:01:59] **Speaker**: vortex based math changes I set up

[00:02:03] **Speaker**: um colors to show me patterns

[00:02:07] **Speaker**: excuse me

[00:02:09] **Speaker**: and what I did was I broke the numbers

[00:02:11] **Speaker**: down into 12 sections so

[00:02:14] **Speaker**: um I started with a zero because I feel

[00:02:16] **Speaker**: like the zero is very important

[00:02:19] **Speaker**: um because

[00:02:20] **Speaker**: everything started with nothing and then

[00:02:23] **Speaker**: from nothing grew through the spirit

[00:02:27] **Speaker**: so

[00:02:29] **Speaker**: um so I started with the 12 our 12th

[00:02:32] **Speaker**: step lands on a 9 Vortex based math

[00:02:36] **Speaker**: go to the second set of twelves again on

[00:02:40] **Speaker**: the 24 Mark lands another nine
um 
[00:02:45] **Speaker**: if you want to look at any of these
slides 
[00:02:48] **Speaker**: at greater link just pause them because

[00:02:49] **Speaker**: I'm going to kind of go through this

[00:02:51] **Speaker**: kind of quickly it's getting late where

[00:02:53] **Speaker**: I am so

[00:02:55] **Speaker**: um and I know a lot a lot of you already

[00:02:56] **Speaker**: know this stuff

[00:02:58] **Speaker**: um 25 through 36 lands on the nine

[00:03:02] **Speaker**: and then 48 this is our fourth step of

[00:03:06] **Speaker**: the twelves and it lands on another nine

[00:03:08] **Speaker**: and then we have our just a random set

[00:03:10] **Speaker**: of numbers so I thought

[00:03:13] **Speaker**: um and then we we have four steps to the

[00:03:16] **Speaker**: twelve and then as you can see on the

[00:03:19] **Speaker**: fifth step

[00:03:20] **Speaker**: uh we have another set and the sixth

[00:03:22] **Speaker**: step my numbers became too large and it

[00:03:26] **Speaker**: would not

[00:03:27] **Speaker**: pull in the BBM so which was okay

[00:03:31] **Speaker**: because the main thing I needed to see I

[00:03:34] **Speaker**: believe I saw which was the fact that

[00:03:36] **Speaker**: the first set of twelves and the fifth

[00:03:40] **Speaker**: set out of twelves it starts over

[00:03:43] **Speaker**: because look at these colors right here

[00:03:45] **Speaker**: pink orange purple blue green you have

[00:03:48] **Speaker**: over here pink orange

[00:03:51] **Speaker**: purple blue green it's the same set of

[00:03:53] **Speaker**: colors

[00:03:55] **Speaker**: so this next slide is just a

[00:03:58] **Speaker**: representation showing uh the first and

[00:04:01] **Speaker**: the fifth steps blown up they're the

[00:04:03] **Speaker**: same colors

[00:04:06] **Speaker**: and this is where it gets really

[00:04:08] **Speaker**: interesting so I set up

[00:04:12] **Speaker**: um in my my Excel sheet the Fibonacci

[00:04:14] **Speaker**: spiral which I know this is not a true

[00:04:17] **Speaker**: representation of the Fibonacci spiral

[00:04:19] **Speaker**: but in order for me to

[00:04:24] **Speaker**: um do what I was gonna do I had to set

[00:04:25] **Speaker**: it up this way so as you can see I

[00:04:28] **Speaker**: highlighted the night that every 12th

[00:04:30] **Speaker**: step in the Bold 144 and so on

[00:04:35] **Speaker**: your other three

[00:04:36] **Speaker**: so what I did was I took this pattern

[00:04:40] **Speaker**: right here and instead of just showing

[00:04:43] **Speaker**: the extremely large digits and numbers I

[00:04:48] **Speaker**: inserted The Vortex space map and this

[00:04:51] **Speaker**: is what I got

[00:04:52] **Speaker**: okay so as you can see this is where I

[00:04:57] **Speaker**: started learning about one two four

[00:04:58] **Speaker**: eight seven five and then three six nine

[00:05:01] **Speaker**: or better yet three three nine six six

[00:05:03] **Speaker**: nine

[00:05:04] **Speaker**: alternating pattern that you see right

[00:05:07] **Speaker**: here

[00:05:08] **Speaker**: here's the one where I started and it

[00:05:10] **Speaker**: popped in all the numbers thereafter and

[00:05:13] **Speaker**: then as you can see on the right hand

[00:05:14] **Speaker**: side you have one eight one eight and we

[00:05:16] **Speaker**: all know it equals nine

[00:05:19] **Speaker**: um

[00:05:19] **Speaker**: and then on this the next step I did the

[00:05:23] **Speaker**: same thing I popped in the two and I

[00:05:25] **Speaker**: highlighted every place which is the
12th step 
[00:05:30] **Speaker**: um

[00:05:30] **Speaker**: and it gives us the vortex base math

[00:05:33] **Speaker**: number as a nine so as you can see

[00:05:37] **Speaker**: here are the highlighted areas with the

[00:05:39] **Speaker**: nine and then again we have one two four
eight seven five one two four eight seven five and then on the right hand 
[00:05:44] **Speaker**: side

[00:05:45] **Speaker**: 7272 which equals nine

[00:05:48] **Speaker**: so I definitely started seeing a pattern

[00:05:50] **Speaker**: and

[00:05:51] **Speaker**: my eyes just became wide open whenever I

[00:05:55] **Speaker**: started doing this for myself I think

[00:05:58] **Speaker**: that's one of the main thing

[00:06:01] **Speaker**: one of the main things learning

[00:06:03] **Speaker**: Fibonacci and Vortex space math and

[00:06:06] **Speaker**: geometry

[00:06:07] **Speaker**: sacred geometry is learning

[00:06:11] **Speaker**: all about this by actually doing it

[00:06:13] **Speaker**: yourself that's when the magic really

[00:06:15] **Speaker**: starts to take place

[00:06:17] **Speaker**: so our next number is the three I popped

[00:06:19] **Speaker**: in the three again same patterns all

[00:06:22] **Speaker**: around this is the pattern I got

[00:06:25] **Speaker**: a little bit different from the previous

[00:06:27] **Speaker**: two that we saw because the three six

[00:06:29] **Speaker**: and none they're very special whereas I

[00:06:33] **Speaker**: believe the one two four eight seven

[00:06:34] **Speaker**: five is the physical aspects and then

[00:06:37] **Speaker**: the 369 is like The Ether the plasma the

[00:06:41] **Speaker**: spirit world of what's taking place in

[00:06:45] **Speaker**: our two worlds one scene and one unseen

[00:06:49] **Speaker**: and then here's our fourth for well

[00:06:53] **Speaker**: beginning with four in our spiral the

[00:06:55] **Speaker**: Fibonacci spiral and then we see

[00:06:59] **Speaker**: The Vortex based math still the same one

[00:07:01] **Speaker**: two four eight seven five and then on

[00:07:04] **Speaker**: the left hand side 369 and on the right

[00:07:06] **Speaker**: hand side whatever number we start with

[00:07:09] **Speaker**: um will will yield the

[00:07:13] **Speaker**: two numbers that equal the nine

[00:07:16] **Speaker**: so the four and the five are blue notice
how this 
[00:07:20] **Speaker**: this

[00:07:21] **Speaker**: um section right here is blue

[00:07:23] **Speaker**: and we go to the five here are your all

[00:07:26] **Speaker**: your numbers

[00:07:28] **Speaker**: and then here's the

[00:07:31] **Speaker**: Vortex based math numbers and again it's

[00:07:34] **Speaker**: not blue anymore it's the yellow so they

[00:07:36] **Speaker**: alternate and then again we're going to

[00:07:39] **Speaker**: see the one two four eight seven five on

[00:07:41] **Speaker**: every single uh slide except for the

[00:07:44] **Speaker**: three six and nine numbers

[00:07:46] **Speaker**: here's our six

[00:07:49] **Speaker**: and here's our pattern same as the three

[00:07:51] **Speaker**: just opposite the light in the dark is

[00:07:54] **Speaker**: going to be opposite

[00:07:56] **Speaker**: and then we have seven

[00:08:04] **Speaker**: and here's the pattern for the vbm

[00:08:09] **Speaker**: same as always here's our eight

[00:08:13] **Speaker**: here's our pattern

[00:08:15] **Speaker**: same same same

[00:08:18] **Speaker**: when you start realizing these things

[00:08:20] **Speaker**: and seeing them for yourself you're like

[00:08:22] **Speaker**: wow it's just it just I think it opens

[00:08:25] **Speaker**: up your eyes in your heart and your mind

[00:08:27] **Speaker**: here's the nine

[00:08:30] **Speaker**: everything equals nine

[00:08:32] **Speaker**: it's definitely the spirit

[00:08:36] **Speaker**: so what I did was I took all the

[00:08:38] **Speaker**: patterns and I just kind of placed them
on the same board um 
[00:08:42] **Speaker**: and you can definitely see there's the

[00:08:44] **Speaker**: one and there's the eight there's the

[00:08:46] **Speaker**: two and there's the seven there's the

[00:08:48] **Speaker**: four and the five and then we have the

[00:08:50] **Speaker**: three and the six and then the nine one

[00:08:53] **Speaker**: two four eight seven five three six nine

[00:08:57] **Speaker**: and then this is my actual Excel sheet

[00:09:00] **Speaker**: um the other slides I just cut and

[00:09:02] **Speaker**: pasted different sections though it

[00:09:03] **Speaker**: wasn't he wasn't blown away with all

[00:09:06] **Speaker**: this information all at one time so

[00:09:08] **Speaker**: um if anybody would ever would like to

[00:09:10] **Speaker**: have this I'll share it with whoever

[00:09:12] **Speaker**: would like a copy

[00:09:15] **Speaker**: um

[00:09:16] **Speaker**: this is the one key that you have to

[00:09:18] **Speaker**: highlight and pop in your number uh it

[00:09:21] **Speaker**: will change everything it will change

[00:09:23] **Speaker**: all these numbers it will change all the

[00:09:25] **Speaker**: colors all the colors in here all the

[00:09:27] **Speaker**: numbers in here it just completely does

[00:09:30] **Speaker**: everything for you uh set it up like

[00:09:32] **Speaker**: that so like it would be simple and easy

[00:09:34] **Speaker**: to manipulate and pull in different

[00:09:37] **Speaker**: numbers

[00:09:38] **Speaker**: I also went on to do

[00:09:40] **Speaker**: um

[00:09:41] **Speaker**: 11122 and

[00:09:45] **Speaker**: I don't know if I can no I'll show you

[00:09:48] **Speaker**: later but um what happens is when you

[00:09:51] **Speaker**: have three integers

[00:09:53] **Speaker**: um that are the same such as one one one

[00:09:56] **Speaker**: that equals three two two two equals six

[00:09:58] **Speaker**: so

[00:09:59] **Speaker**: all the triple digit numbers will yield

[00:10:03] **Speaker**: all the three six and nines so that's

[00:10:05] **Speaker**: kind of that was kind of interesting as
well 
[00:10:08] **Speaker**: um

[00:10:09] **Speaker**: so what I did I was just

[00:10:11] **Speaker**: clipped every single one of these Pages

[00:10:13] **Speaker**: just so you could see for yourself the

[00:10:16] **Speaker**: numbers and the patterns and how it's

[00:10:19] **Speaker**: arranged in my my worksheet

[00:10:22] **Speaker**: and then what I did was I um I overlaid

[00:10:26] **Speaker**: two patterns I took the one and the

[00:10:28] **Speaker**: eight and I overlaid them and what I

[00:10:31] **Speaker**: started to see was

[00:10:34] **Speaker**: um right here the one in the eight

[00:10:36] **Speaker**: overlap and then the 369 overlap so that

[00:10:39] **Speaker**: was not really a big deal but what I

[00:10:43] **Speaker**: started seeing as I was

[00:10:45] **Speaker**: um

[00:10:46] **Speaker**: turning these down and up I said well

[00:10:49] **Speaker**: let me look at those numbers and I

[00:10:50] **Speaker**: started looking at the pattern of the

[00:10:54] **Speaker**: overlapping and as you can see you have

[00:10:57] **Speaker**: eight and one four and five two and

[00:10:59] **Speaker**: seven all equals nine

[00:11:01] **Speaker**: so now everything when this whole
two 
[00:11:06] **Speaker**: um

[00:11:07] **Speaker**: two worksheets combined are equal and
none 
[00:11:17] **Speaker**: this one right here I just overlaid into

[00:11:19] **Speaker**: a cross section

[00:11:21] **Speaker**: so again you're seeing the four and the

[00:11:24] **Speaker**: five overlap the three six and the nine

[00:11:26] **Speaker**: and then kind of funny right here is I

[00:11:30] **Speaker**: started seeing the skin of the Taurus

[00:11:33] **Speaker**: so

[00:11:35] **Speaker**: that kind of signifies how you actually

[00:11:39] **Speaker**: derive at this the skin of the Torso I

[00:11:42] **Speaker**: have not tried anything with the the

[00:11:44] **Speaker**: donuts yet I kind of wanted to start out

[00:11:47] **Speaker**: small and I just I don't I don't think

[00:11:50] **Speaker**: I've really seen anybody laid the

[00:11:53] **Speaker**: pattern out kind of like this with the

[00:11:55] **Speaker**: colors and everything so I don't know if

[00:11:56] **Speaker**: it's new I don't know I know that the

[00:11:59] **Speaker**: concept of everything is not new but

[00:12:02] **Speaker**: just the way that I arranged everything

[00:12:03] **Speaker**: I hope that

[00:12:06] **Speaker**: um somebody find juice for it and that

[00:12:09] **Speaker**: we work together and and help bring

[00:12:11] **Speaker**: about change through all these patterns

[00:12:14] **Speaker**: so what I do on this slide is I took two

[00:12:17] **Speaker**: of the boxes or the Fibonacci spiral

[00:12:19] **Speaker**: sequence in the vortex based math and I

[00:12:22] **Speaker**: kind of arranged them by each other and

[00:12:24] **Speaker**: as you can see you're going to see the

[00:12:27] **Speaker**: Helix of the DNA spiral the sine wave

[00:12:32] **Speaker**: the octaves the

[00:12:35] **Speaker**: um

[00:12:35] **Speaker**: surgery the tones the frequencies uh

[00:12:40] **Speaker**: ripples I mean anything that you've ever

[00:12:44] **Speaker**: seen with your physical eyes

[00:12:46] **Speaker**: is going to derive from this pattern

[00:12:49] **Speaker**: right here the wave the

[00:12:52] **Speaker**: The Vortex it's all about the vortex I'm

[00:12:55] **Speaker**: obsessed with the vortex

[00:12:58] **Speaker**: um and then on my last slide right here

[00:13:00] **Speaker**: I just took the nine pattern and I kind

[00:13:02] **Speaker**: of flipped in and turned them and

[00:13:05] **Speaker**: so quickly you can spot this shape right

[00:13:08] **Speaker**: here but then you have right in here

[00:13:11] **Speaker**: um the same pattern it's just kind of a

[00:13:13] **Speaker**: little bit more hidden kind of like kind

[00:13:15] **Speaker**: of looks like going in and out up and

[00:13:19] **Speaker**: down

[00:13:20] **Speaker**: um just the toroidal flow and the

[00:13:24] **Speaker**: mapping of of a two day 2D

[00:13:26] **Speaker**: representation of how it looks laid out

[00:13:30] **Speaker**: flat

[00:13:32] **Speaker**: so I hope someone gained something from

[00:13:36] **Speaker**: this and I hope that you guys will give

[00:13:39] **Speaker**: me feedback on what you liked what you

[00:13:41] **Speaker**: didn't like what I could change what I

[00:13:43] **Speaker**: could do different

[00:13:45] **Speaker**: um I'm just here to

[00:13:47] **Speaker**: learn from like-minded in individuals

[00:13:50] **Speaker**: such as myself and I also say that my

[00:13:54] **Speaker**: heart and mind are wide open I listen to

[00:13:58] **Speaker**: anything I respect everyone and I

[00:14:02] **Speaker**: definitely have been taught Where We Are

[00:14:06] **Speaker**: and from my beliefs I believe that we

[00:14:09] **Speaker**: are inside our creator just as our cells

[00:14:12] **Speaker**: are inside of us when I started seeing

[00:14:15] **Speaker**: all these patterns it just became so

[00:14:17] **Speaker**: obvious and real to me that

[00:14:20] **Speaker**: um

[00:14:21] **Speaker**: it just

[00:14:23] **Speaker**: it's what's been teaching me and showing

[00:14:26] **Speaker**: me things and for all this I'm thankful

[00:14:29] **Speaker**: and I just pray that this blesses you

[00:14:33] **Speaker**: have a great night and great morning
