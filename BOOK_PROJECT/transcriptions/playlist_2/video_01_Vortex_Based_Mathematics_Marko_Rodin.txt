[00:00:00] **Speaker**: okay
um 
[00:00:05] **Speaker**: okay

[00:00:07] **Speaker**: what I am where I'm going to start with

[00:00:10] **Speaker**: is um this is uh gonna be

[00:00:16] **Speaker**: I'm gonna try and not talk is what I'm

[00:00:18] **Speaker**: trying to do

[00:00:19] **Speaker**: so I'm trying to do visual

[00:00:22] **Speaker**: this is a standard coil
let's see 
[00:00:28] **Speaker**: this is a standard coil the grand

[00:00:31] **Speaker**: unified field Theory inexhaustible

[00:00:32] **Speaker**: energy and all diseases produce

[00:00:34] **Speaker**: unlimited food travel anywhere in the

[00:00:36] **Speaker**: universe Fusion Vortex energy ionic

[00:00:39] **Speaker**: acoustic levitation gravitons the

[00:00:41] **Speaker**: ultimate fundamental particle in the

[00:00:43] **Speaker**: universe the underpinning geometry of

[00:00:44] **Speaker**: the universe morphogenic Fields flux

[00:00:47] **Speaker**: Thruster atom pulsar

[00:00:50] **Speaker**: okay this is what the rodent coil name

[00:00:53] **Speaker**: it after me I had a different name for

[00:00:55] **Speaker**: it

[00:00:56] **Speaker**: that's the rodent Club I call it the

[00:00:58] **Speaker**: flex Thruster atom pulsar but it didn't
catch on 
[00:01:03] **Speaker**: um

[00:01:05] **Speaker**: that's my logo times of I plus and minus

[00:01:07] **Speaker**: the One logo that's because I figured

[00:01:10] **Speaker**: out how to do all the functions of math

[00:01:13] **Speaker**: instantly

[00:01:15] **Speaker**: okay the topic is called Point Energy

[00:01:17] **Speaker**: creation physics my company's

[00:01:19] **Speaker**: aerodynamics it's not the error in the

[00:01:21] **Speaker**: atmosphere it's a lumafarious ether as

[00:01:25] **Speaker**: our very informative gentleman friend

[00:01:28] **Speaker**: Alistair was mentioning that it's an

[00:01:31] **Speaker**: inertia ether on top of that it's not a

[00:01:33] **Speaker**: static stationary ether the conventional

[00:01:35] **Speaker**: Education and Training that everyone had

[00:01:36] **Speaker**: is they still related to kind of as like

[00:01:38] **Speaker**: a loquacious Jello I hate Saint Collins

[00:01:41] **Speaker**: something a loquacious Jello but you

[00:01:44] **Speaker**: know with Jello food colors and

[00:01:45] **Speaker**: everything else it's not a Jello the

[00:01:48] **Speaker**: this invisible fluid it's a pulse it's a

[00:01:50] **Speaker**: surgeon it has a vector has a phasing it

[00:01:54] **Speaker**: has every attribute and property that we
can imagine and that's what we're going to learn 
[00:01:58] **Speaker**: about

[00:01:59] **Speaker**: are you saying it's within 3D it creates

[00:02:03] **Speaker**: 3D it is it is inseparable from 3D it

[00:02:06] **Speaker**: makes a 3D it is it
um 
[00:02:15] **Speaker**: your everybody here is representative is

[00:02:18] **Speaker**: Professor Glennon think of it as if he

[00:02:20] **Speaker**: if he doesn't win your case here then he

[00:02:24] **Speaker**: doesn't he goes home to his office and

[00:02:26] **Speaker**: you all go to jail he's going to

[00:02:28] **Speaker**: represent you yeah you're the

[00:02:31] **Speaker**: representative

[00:02:33] **Speaker**: we asked the first question
um 
[00:02:36] **Speaker**: the

[00:02:38] **Speaker**: what it is is it's linear it doesn't

[00:02:40] **Speaker**: bend the whole topic today is about the

[00:02:43] **Speaker**: number nine what now number Nine's but a

[00:02:46] **Speaker**: big Mystique in everything we know Cloud

[00:02:48] **Speaker**: Nine uh Love Potion Number Nine

[00:02:52] **Speaker**: um the most great name of God equals

[00:02:54] **Speaker**: number nine in the Baha'i scriptures is

[00:02:57] **Speaker**: the equation for it two one five one

[00:02:58] **Speaker**: we'll come to that to answer your

[00:03:00] **Speaker**: question specifically about number not

[00:03:02] **Speaker**: about this energy

[00:03:04] **Speaker**: this energy is the only thing that comes

[00:03:07] **Speaker**: from the whole from zero The Vortex it

[00:03:11] **Speaker**: goes out linearly in all directions it

[00:03:13] **Speaker**: doesn't nothing can resist it

[00:03:16] **Speaker**: nothing can resist it it penetrates

[00:03:19] **Speaker**: everything it leaves its reticulation

[00:03:22] **Speaker**: pattern it leaves a grain it animates

[00:03:25] **Speaker**: everything it is the source of the
non-decang spin of the electron you take 
[00:03:28] **Speaker**: this energy away and the universe will

[00:03:29] **Speaker**: become destitute and avoid okay

[00:03:32] **Speaker**: because you can't really talk about it

[00:03:34] **Speaker**: as layer because that's reference to 3D

[00:03:36] **Speaker**: it's your z-axis

[00:03:39] **Speaker**: okay

[00:03:40] **Speaker**: um you have your your vertical axis your

[00:03:44] **Speaker**: horizontal axis and then you have your

[00:03:47] **Speaker**: z-axis which is distinct from the

[00:03:50] **Speaker**: surface topology

[00:03:51] **Speaker**: okay of the logarithmic spiral
okay okay 
[00:04:01] **Speaker**: we will cover this if this topic will

[00:04:04] **Speaker**: re-emerge what we're addressing right

[00:04:05] **Speaker**: now every two minutes but he just

[00:04:08] **Speaker**: started will never be finished we're

[00:04:11] **Speaker**: gonna

[00:04:11] **Speaker**: tackle it from Every Avenue

[00:04:14] **Speaker**: okay that's going to be like a line and

[00:04:16] **Speaker**: we're going to grab it by the tail okay

[00:04:18] **Speaker**: so this coil is this what a coil looks

[00:04:21] **Speaker**: like this is a standard conventional

[00:04:23] **Speaker**: coil it's all parasitic these were

[00:04:25] **Speaker**: certified results from either Packard

[00:04:27] **Speaker**: that I am indeed getting double the

[00:04:28] **Speaker**: output that our mathematics or numbers

[00:04:30] **Speaker**: were not

[00:04:32] **Speaker**: false that they were authentic they

[00:04:35] **Speaker**: validated it you use millions of dollars

[00:04:37] **Speaker**: to test equipment and this is the rodent

[00:04:39] **Speaker**: coil without the parasitics as compared

[00:04:41] **Speaker**: to a standard coil showing that there is

[00:04:43] **Speaker**: not resistance

[00:04:45] **Speaker**: here there's not harmonic discordance

[00:04:48] **Speaker**: there is not friction my whole goal is

[00:04:50] **Speaker**: to get rid of friction to get rid of

[00:04:52] **Speaker**: resistance is to make electricity

[00:04:54] **Speaker**: synchronized and the kind of electricity

[00:04:56] **Speaker**: that I'm making is synchronized

[00:04:58] **Speaker**: electricity
okay 
[00:05:04] **Speaker**: this is a standard coil but I'm going to

[00:05:07] **Speaker**: turn it into the rodent coil a standard

[00:05:09] **Speaker**: coil is based on how many wraps you have

[00:05:11] **Speaker**: around the outside those are called

[00:05:12] **Speaker**: turns and they say that determines in

[00:05:15] **Speaker**: your magnetic output inductance and

[00:05:17] **Speaker**: stuff it's totally

[00:05:19] **Speaker**: primitive science

[00:05:21] **Speaker**: what I found what they were shocked at

[00:05:23] **Speaker**: Hewlett Packard is nobody could even say

[00:05:25] **Speaker**: it's because of this they tried to make

[00:05:27] **Speaker**: up they said there must be some other

[00:05:29] **Speaker**: reason everybody said but they came to

[00:05:31] **Speaker**: the conclusions what I said from the

[00:05:32] **Speaker**: beginning it is the geometry alone of

[00:05:35] **Speaker**: the wire that's producing all this extra

[00:05:37] **Speaker**: magnetism

[00:05:39] **Speaker**: okay

[00:05:41] **Speaker**: they said there would be a 20 savings

[00:05:44] **Speaker**: in Copper alone using this design for
big transformers they said even a five 
[00:05:48] **Speaker**: percent of copper would have been

[00:05:50] **Speaker**: immense of course that wasn't my goal to

[00:05:52] **Speaker**: use alternating current my goal was to

[00:05:53] **Speaker**: obsolete it and get rid of it I'm a

[00:05:56] **Speaker**: just tear the veils down with a roaring

[00:05:59] **Speaker**: crashing sound kind of guy and I I my

[00:06:01] **Speaker**: goal is to replace it with a whole

[00:06:03] **Speaker**: nother type of Technology one other type

[00:06:05] **Speaker**: of energy and do it with the big noise

[00:06:07] **Speaker**: okay

[00:06:08] **Speaker**: so how I change this coil okay we have

[00:06:12] **Speaker**: two wires okay first of all and this is

[00:06:16] **Speaker**: this is the best we can do on Art so

[00:06:18] **Speaker**: please be understand this is it's light
it's portable and that's why it uses 
[00:06:22] **Speaker**: tarps they're wonderful mediums and yes

[00:06:24] **Speaker**: you can use my idea anytime you need to

[00:06:25] **Speaker**: make a presentation it only costs seven

[00:06:27] **Speaker**: dollars and a sure piece of 500 sign

[00:06:29] **Speaker**: from a retail

[00:06:32] **Speaker**: so and these are I'm using dry erase and

[00:06:35] **Speaker**: these other ones were permanent markers

[00:06:36] **Speaker**: and it's the big tip

[00:06:39] **Speaker**: okay

[00:06:40] **Speaker**: so

[00:06:42] **Speaker**: what I did was I had two wires one's red

[00:06:44] **Speaker**: one's blue one of them electricity goes
out the other one the electricity goes 
[00:06:49] **Speaker**: in

[00:06:50] **Speaker**: everyone follow me pretty easy in one of

[00:06:53] **Speaker**: now it's always based on thirds it's

[00:06:55] **Speaker**: called a binary triplet okay

[00:06:58] **Speaker**: it's real important this the fact that

[00:07:00] **Speaker**: when I'm talking about something that's

[00:07:01] **Speaker**: binary but it's really a binary third

[00:07:03] **Speaker**: and I know that's a mind bother how can

[00:07:05] **Speaker**: that be but I'll show you okay so the

[00:07:09] **Speaker**: third you always leave alone it's an

[00:07:11] **Speaker**: empty space you don't put anything there

[00:07:13] **Speaker**: that's where the ether on flux magnetic

[00:07:15] **Speaker**: field in other words let's just say

[00:07:16] **Speaker**: that's where the field occurs okay are

[00:07:18] **Speaker**: you doing your coil now yeah okay I'm

[00:07:21] **Speaker**: going to turn it into my coil right now

[00:07:22] **Speaker**: it's a conventional plug see how steep

[00:07:25] **Speaker**: the slope is that's a normal quilt the

[00:07:27] **Speaker**: rodent coil it's a very gradual type

[00:07:31] **Speaker**: incline see how slow it Twirls in like

[00:07:35] **Speaker**: water in a whirlpool

[00:07:36] **Speaker**: okay it's this least acute incline as

[00:07:40] **Speaker**: you can have in Winding this coil on

[00:07:42] **Speaker**: this bit with using three parts
any questions Charlie 
[00:07:53] **Speaker**: I'm using and it's only from how I

[00:07:56] **Speaker**: interpret my numbers I think it's PDC
Foster at current to tell you the truth though 
[00:08:02] **Speaker**: I didn't make this coin I'm not the

[00:08:03] **Speaker**: electrical engineer I am

[00:08:06] **Speaker**: um

[00:08:07] **Speaker**: we all know I'm the presenter today okay

[00:08:09] **Speaker**: and I hate to say that that I I'm not

[00:08:12] **Speaker**: the person who does all this stuff

[00:08:14] **Speaker**: essentially you Charlie and everyone
else are going to have to be the one 
[00:08:18] **Speaker**: who's gonna have to

[00:08:20] **Speaker**: coax out of these inventions how to

[00:08:23] **Speaker**: activate them and how to harness it okay

[00:08:26] **Speaker**: and that's what it takes in electrical

[00:08:27] **Speaker**: engineering you just don't go and give

[00:08:30] **Speaker**: any electrical engineer an invention a

[00:08:33] **Speaker**: coil and say turn it on they have to

[00:08:35] **Speaker**: play with it they have to and that's

[00:08:37] **Speaker**: they have to have a finesse to to

[00:08:41] **Speaker**: what would be a term for it to to warm

[00:08:45] **Speaker**: to you have to massage it

[00:08:49] **Speaker**: okay you have to massage because you

[00:08:51] **Speaker**: have to work with the different type of

[00:08:52] **Speaker**: sine waves have to work with the
different types of voltage a lot of people say it's not electrical coil let's say it's a field generator coil it's totally different than electrical 
[00:08:59] **Speaker**: plug

[00:09:01] **Speaker**: okay

[00:09:03] **Speaker**: that's certainly true because the

[00:09:04] **Speaker**: magnetic field on this coil they've

[00:09:06] **Speaker**: never seen a magnetic field like this

[00:09:09] **Speaker**: the field is not like the standard

[00:09:11] **Speaker**: conventional coil the field is contained

[00:09:13] **Speaker**: in the Torx and they don't have to

[00:09:15] **Speaker**: Shield it in the FDC what is it FCC uh

[00:09:18] **Speaker**: the airplanes whatever
they they're happy with these kind of clothes because they don't need 
[00:09:23] **Speaker**: shielding

[00:09:25] **Speaker**: but the

[00:09:28] **Speaker**: rodent coil doesn't have its field on

[00:09:31] **Speaker**: the inside my coil is a total inversion

[00:09:34] **Speaker**: type coil all my field is evenly

[00:09:35] **Speaker**: distributed over the surface of the coil

[00:09:38] **Speaker**: it's just the opposite of what the other

[00:09:40] **Speaker**: one's doing I better I think we should

[00:09:43] **Speaker**: share names okay start this way we'll

[00:09:46] **Speaker**: come around

[00:09:48] **Speaker**: Ikea
growing 
[00:09:57] **Speaker**: Jiva Marsh
Charlie 
[00:10:04] **Speaker**: Sun Shines right right

[00:10:08] **Speaker**: and Marco Urban Bob
um 
[00:10:15] **Speaker**: okay now
so 
[00:10:24] **Speaker**: in turning this

[00:10:26] **Speaker**: into a rodent coil

[00:10:28] **Speaker**: how I do it is I go from

[00:10:32] **Speaker**: one

[00:10:34] **Speaker**: to two Okay so the blue wire here will

[00:10:39] **Speaker**: go all the way across through the vortex
and we'll go over here to connect to 
[00:10:43] **Speaker**: there

[00:10:44] **Speaker**: and then two

[00:10:47] **Speaker**: will go to

[00:10:49] **Speaker**: three it'll come out over here it's kind

[00:10:51] **Speaker**: of hard to tell where it comes out so I

[00:10:54] **Speaker**: just want to go like that it'll go like

[00:10:55] **Speaker**: this and then three will go to four over

[00:10:58] **Speaker**: here where it's four right here

[00:11:01] **Speaker**: okay and it's going in spiers

[00:11:04] **Speaker**: okay

[00:11:05] **Speaker**: so and then um one two three and then

[00:11:09] **Speaker**: four will go to Five is that right which
is way over here 
[00:11:16] **Speaker**: now the important thing is

[00:11:18] **Speaker**: is I began at one I passed it on the one

[00:11:22] **Speaker**: two on the third time around it's

[00:11:25] **Speaker**: already going expires these wires normal

[00:11:28] **Speaker**: coils they just begin go around and stop

[00:11:29] **Speaker**: where they began

[00:11:31] **Speaker**: but what I'm doing is I'm actually

[00:11:32] **Speaker**: building a star

[00:11:34] **Speaker**: okay which is real significant okay and

[00:11:38] **Speaker**: now here's the thing once you pass in

[00:11:40] **Speaker**: the Spire here and it crosses the here

[00:11:43] **Speaker**: this winding is at a right angle to that

[00:11:45] **Speaker**: winding all my Fields now I have a

[00:11:47] **Speaker**: unique angle to them and on top of it

[00:11:50] **Speaker**: I'm creating that you can't see it I do

[00:11:52] **Speaker**: have a chart on it an invisible

[00:11:53] **Speaker**: polarization in between the spiers where

[00:11:57] **Speaker**: they pass each other

[00:11:58] **Speaker**: okay does everyone follow that a little

[00:12:00] **Speaker**: bit it's okay I just wanted you to see

[00:12:02] **Speaker**: this chart and just get an idea how it's

[00:12:04] **Speaker**: went now there's two wires so that was

[00:12:06] **Speaker**: the blue wire so the red wire would have
been doing the same thing 
[00:12:13] **Speaker**: um which would have been going one two

[00:12:15] **Speaker**: and it's the space remember it's always

[00:12:17] **Speaker**: in between them

[00:12:18] **Speaker**: um three

[00:12:20] **Speaker**: where next

[00:12:22] **Speaker**: um

[00:12:24] **Speaker**: one two that wasn't three I was five
wow 
[00:12:30] **Speaker**: trees over here there we go three
four five 
[00:12:41] **Speaker**: all righty
thank you 
[00:12:45] **Speaker**: two

[00:12:47] **Speaker**: it's two windings

[00:12:53] **Speaker**: one no one separate circuits separate

[00:12:56] **Speaker**: wires not ever to be related

[00:12:59] **Speaker**: it's a by failure coil there's two

[00:13:01] **Speaker**: windings exactly right just like male

[00:13:04] **Speaker**: female there's it's a duality

[00:13:07] **Speaker**: except there's a It's really trinary

[00:13:09] **Speaker**: because the invisible space in between

[00:13:11] **Speaker**: the red and the blue are the two white

[00:13:14] **Speaker**: exactly

[00:13:15] **Speaker**: right and the white is the higher

[00:13:18] **Speaker**: dimensional energy

[00:13:19] **Speaker**: okay which is going to be explaining
your number nine 
[00:13:23] **Speaker**: um
it's interesting 
[00:13:27] **Speaker**: one morning because it's going through

[00:13:30] **Speaker**: three different that's going to it's one

[00:13:33] **Speaker**: wire that eventually comes around now

[00:13:35] **Speaker**: we're going to look at an easier chart

[00:13:37] **Speaker**: so we'll look at the chart that depicts

[00:13:39] **Speaker**: it a little bit easier
okay 
[00:13:51] **Speaker**: let's see if I have where that chart is
here it is 
[00:13:58] **Speaker**: okay so the chart that depicts that a
little 
[00:14:03] **Speaker**: is this one right here this is one

[00:14:04] **Speaker**: lining this is the other winding and the

[00:14:07] **Speaker**: space is always wrappered by represented

[00:14:08] **Speaker**: by 396. six three plus six equals nine

[00:14:12] **Speaker**: three and three is six uh so the dotted

[00:14:15] **Speaker**: line is always threes and six three it's

[00:14:17] **Speaker**: going three six anything that's a

[00:14:20] **Speaker**: multiple of three you leave alone

[00:14:21] **Speaker**: okay

[00:14:23] **Speaker**: so here's the windings

[00:14:25] **Speaker**: and a half so one goes to here to here

[00:14:28] **Speaker**: to here here's your right angle one and

[00:14:30] **Speaker**: ten are right angles to one another

[00:14:32] **Speaker**: which was the third one one two three

[00:14:34] **Speaker**: and we're on the fourth everyone follow
that 
[00:14:38] **Speaker**: and this is one wire this is two wire

[00:14:40] **Speaker**: but I have to separate them because when

[00:14:41] **Speaker**: you look at this you can't tell that

[00:14:43] **Speaker**: there's two together

[00:14:45] **Speaker**: okay this is the construct for

[00:14:47] **Speaker**: Perfection for everything in the

[00:14:49] **Speaker**: universe is based on that which you will

[00:14:51] **Speaker**: know shortly

[00:14:53] **Speaker**: they also use this to produce Fusion

[00:14:55] **Speaker**: this is a fusion reactor and um

[00:15:00] **Speaker**: I call one the right wing circuit one

[00:15:02] **Speaker**: the left doubling circuit the winding

[00:15:04] **Speaker**: schematic for an exhaustible energy I

[00:15:07] **Speaker**: call the Primal point of unity as a

[00:15:08] **Speaker**: whole right here where the emanations

[00:15:10] **Speaker**: coming out of it

[00:15:13] **Speaker**: um number two for permutations defining

[00:15:16] **Speaker**: the invisible

[00:15:18] **Speaker**: and that's what we're going to be
learning is number of permutations how 
[00:15:21] **Speaker**: they work
okay 
[00:15:25] **Speaker**: can everyone see that real well yeah

[00:15:27] **Speaker**: okay

[00:15:29] **Speaker**: now

[00:15:32] **Speaker**: I might I might tell you that the reason

[00:15:34] **Speaker**: I'm I'm explaining to you in such a

[00:15:37] **Speaker**: technical fashion right now is because

[00:15:40] **Speaker**: um

[00:15:42] **Speaker**: it's because I needed some variation in
how I've been presenting it 
[00:15:46] **Speaker**: mathematically

[00:15:48] **Speaker**: so this is kind of like my change of

[00:15:50] **Speaker**: theme for man so this is a whole

[00:15:52] **Speaker**: different so so instead explaining it to

[00:15:55] **Speaker**: you now this way because
um 
[00:15:58] **Speaker**: the other day I've been explaining in

[00:16:00] **Speaker**: schools and I've been doing it mostly

[00:16:02] **Speaker**: mathematically but okay so here's my

[00:16:07] **Speaker**: flyer I want to get classes

[00:16:10] **Speaker**: um that's been at the Manoa Innovation

[00:16:11] **Speaker**: Center I can give them at many different

[00:16:13] **Speaker**: places these are the topics Jane gave me

[00:16:15] **Speaker**: a beautiful flyer it's in the shape of a
pyramid 
[00:16:19] **Speaker**: all my friends who helped me on this

[00:16:21] **Speaker**: it's all been a free gift they donate

[00:16:23] **Speaker**: their time and help I'm very blessed for

[00:16:26] **Speaker**: that because otherwise I would not even

[00:16:28] **Speaker**: be around

[00:16:30] **Speaker**: I'd be

[00:16:32] **Speaker**: sleeping on a Shipwrecked Beach

[00:16:34] **Speaker**: someplace I don't

[00:16:37] **Speaker**: don't laugh

[00:16:39] **Speaker**: this is from my home page

[00:16:41] **Speaker**: okay

[00:16:43] **Speaker**: and this is um that's my home page

[00:16:45] **Speaker**: number rodent.org these are my letters

[00:16:48] **Speaker**: corresponses web and Page Mail article

[00:16:50] **Speaker**: scientific results we haven't gotten

[00:16:52] **Speaker**: hardly anything up there yet

[00:16:54] **Speaker**: but we'll have it up there in about 30

[00:16:56] **Speaker**: days we've got pictures up there so far

[00:16:59] **Speaker**: I'm Marco Rhoden do declare with

[00:17:01] **Speaker**: Witnesses present that I am hereby

[00:17:03] **Speaker**: giving to the world to use my complete

[00:17:05] **Speaker**: work aerodynamics the dandelion puff

[00:17:07] **Speaker**: principle Point Energy creation physics

[00:17:08] **Speaker**: in return for one-third one-third of the

[00:17:11] **Speaker**: gross of all income derived there from

[00:17:14] **Speaker**: this is to be debased upon the honor

[00:17:16] **Speaker**: System with no legal recourse but either

[00:17:19] **Speaker**: in all parties concerned everything

[00:17:25] **Speaker**: in the trust of the public domain may

[00:17:28] **Speaker**: all of mankind profit there from further

[00:17:30] **Speaker**: it is my will that any money derived

[00:17:32] **Speaker**: there from shall be used to print and

[00:17:34] **Speaker**: disseminate the hidden words of a high

[00:17:36] **Speaker**: Sacred Scriptures much Aloha and
foreign 
[00:17:42] **Speaker**: this is when I started making the coil

[00:17:44] **Speaker**: correctly because I'm making it out of a

[00:17:45] **Speaker**: plasma gas this has paid 100 for a

[00:17:48] **Speaker**: prototype Flex Thruster Adam poster

[00:17:49] **Speaker**: rodent coil made out of glass tubes and

[00:17:51] **Speaker**: Argon gas to be hand blown by George

[00:17:53] **Speaker**: Glasser would you believe that his last

[00:17:54] **Speaker**: name is Glasser he's from time to

[00:17:57] **Speaker**: Memorial they've been blowing glass from

[00:17:59] **Speaker**: Germany he escaped out of Germany and I

[00:18:02] **Speaker**: think it was uh 85 it just hung in there

[00:18:05] **Speaker**: a little longer he could have walked out

[00:18:06] **Speaker**: and

[00:18:08] **Speaker**: um he didn't he didn't tongue a lot or

[00:18:10] **Speaker**: anything they actually threw him out for

[00:18:12] **Speaker**: it's interesting because they swim out
because the fact that they put him in jail for a year and when it's time to release him he said he was going to tell 
[00:18:18] **Speaker**: him how bad the system was and stuff and

[00:18:19] **Speaker**: he was just such an outspoken guy they

[00:18:21] **Speaker**: just threw him out which is I guess it

[00:18:24] **Speaker**: was easier than fighting them any longer

[00:18:26] **Speaker**: so uh and it's the families from time

[00:18:28] **Speaker**: Memorial been blowing glass

[00:18:31] **Speaker**: um

[00:18:32] **Speaker**: okay

[00:18:34] **Speaker**: this is um
let's see 
[00:18:40] **Speaker**: this is some of my places where I've

[00:18:42] **Speaker**: taught airspace America George Bush was

[00:18:45] **Speaker**: a Master of Ceremonies there was 30

[00:18:46] **Speaker**: congressmen pregnant

[00:18:49] **Speaker**: they all had

[00:18:52] **Speaker**: well I was just gonna say that I had red

[00:18:54] **Speaker**: jackets and black ties

[00:18:57] **Speaker**: um it was it wasn't really all that that

[00:19:00] **Speaker**: pretty really and uh everyone had I had

[00:19:03] **Speaker**: like my only dining room table it was

[00:19:05] **Speaker**: not it was just hard work and nobody

[00:19:08] **Speaker**: understood a thing anyway but they said

[00:19:11] **Speaker**: I had the most revolutionary propulsion

[00:19:12] **Speaker**: system ever created

[00:19:14] **Speaker**: and um this technically was pulling

[00:19:16] **Speaker**: Electronics General atomics is right

[00:19:18] **Speaker**: here for work in Fusion well I decided I

[00:19:21] **Speaker**: better do my work in DNA as I which was

[00:19:24] **Speaker**: my goal so I actually

[00:19:27] **Speaker**: as you are going about to learn about

[00:19:29] **Speaker**: DNA figured out the secret of DNA right
and so this is I published it the biggest genetic engineering conference 
[00:19:35] **Speaker**: in the world this is the most heavily

[00:19:36] **Speaker**: attended in the world these are all

[00:19:38] **Speaker**: doctors with PhD here's senior research

[00:19:41] **Speaker**: scientists here's another doctor VP

[00:19:44] **Speaker**: process development and here's me I

[00:19:47] **Speaker**: should have been a subtitle I guess
we'll call me um 
[00:19:51] **Speaker**: resident

[00:19:53] **Speaker**: I guess

[00:19:54] **Speaker**: what

[00:19:56] **Speaker**: tell me resident

[00:19:59] **Speaker**: um

[00:20:01] **Speaker**: mind jogler or whatever

[00:20:03] **Speaker**: mind jogger
um 
[00:20:06] **Speaker**: and then the response to my work here

[00:20:08] **Speaker**: was went to the German the German

[00:20:10] **Speaker**: Journal about causes studied cancer so

[00:20:12] **Speaker**: my work's a of extreme importance to

[00:20:14] **Speaker**: Media conclusions are very likely I

[00:20:16] **Speaker**: recommend your paper for publication in
the German Journal oncology please keep 
[00:20:19] **Speaker**: me informed of your further work

[00:20:21] **Speaker**: sincerely Dr hanzai

[00:20:23] **Speaker**: that was very flattering

[00:20:25] **Speaker**: um I expect people to endorse my work

[00:20:28] **Speaker**: I'll tell you something though I get

[00:20:30] **Speaker**: huge endorsements the number one I can

[00:20:33] **Speaker**: teach anywhere in the world I want but

[00:20:35] **Speaker**: the higher Earth endorsements they

[00:20:37] **Speaker**: understand very very little of my work

[00:20:39] **Speaker**: very little but they immediately

[00:20:42] **Speaker**: identity had certain experiences in

[00:20:45] **Speaker**: their life over their 10 20 30 40 years

[00:20:47] **Speaker**: in their profession and as soon as they

[00:20:49] **Speaker**: see the work and they look at it it

[00:20:51] **Speaker**: makes a connection if something happened

[00:20:52] **Speaker**: 10 years ago like the president of an

[00:20:55] **Speaker**: organization Bob elix said I had the

[00:20:57] **Speaker**: most detail and quality ever done on

[00:20:59] **Speaker**: tour it's the best they ever saw and he

[00:21:01] **Speaker**: goes on tells me about the story about

[00:21:03] **Speaker**: how this man was working on the same

[00:21:04] **Speaker**: thing the military held him captive and

[00:21:06] **Speaker**: he had to actually climb out over the

[00:21:08] **Speaker**: fence to get out of that compound all

[00:21:10] **Speaker**: these weird things but I get all these

[00:21:12] **Speaker**: incredible compliments but do they

[00:21:15] **Speaker**: really understand my work no

[00:21:17] **Speaker**: and that's what my goal is okay my goal

[00:21:20] **Speaker**: is not I went here to get my work
understood not to get these endorsements 
[00:21:23] **Speaker**: I started at the top because I thought

[00:21:25] **Speaker**: it would be the easiest okay actually

[00:21:26] **Speaker**: the easiest is educating you like going

[00:21:30] **Speaker**: through lesson and it's you who's going

[00:21:33] **Speaker**: to have to figure out out of everyone

[00:21:35] **Speaker**: else is going to win this

[00:21:36] **Speaker**: does that make sense
okay um 
[00:21:41] **Speaker**: okay the first thing next I'm going to

[00:21:44] **Speaker**: do

[00:21:45] **Speaker**: is put these over here

[00:21:53] **Speaker**: um put this here here's our good old

[00:21:55] **Speaker**: multiplication table and I hope I don't

[00:21:58] **Speaker**: do anything wrong

[00:21:59] **Speaker**: I'm going to try

[00:22:02] **Speaker**: to take down our coil

[00:22:05] **Speaker**: so

[00:22:07] **Speaker**: here's a side view of the coil here's

[00:22:10] **Speaker**: the emanations coming out

[00:22:13] **Speaker**: these green arrows emanations are the

[00:22:15] **Speaker**: focal Center it is Spirit it is what

[00:22:18] **Speaker**: Charlie asked about which was what was

[00:22:20] **Speaker**: your question earlier again Charlie what

[00:22:22] **Speaker**: is the nine the z-axis

[00:22:24] **Speaker**: um yeah it was the um let me talk about

[00:22:27] **Speaker**: linearity you're implying 3D because

[00:22:29] **Speaker**: that's really a metaphor right

[00:22:33] **Speaker**: linearity

[00:22:35] **Speaker**: linearity creates 3D

[00:22:37] **Speaker**: okay in other words when the ivy Vines

[00:22:40] **Speaker**: are crawling in the jungle okay they and

[00:22:43] **Speaker**: everything's warped and curved they have

[00:22:44] **Speaker**: to have a substrate they have to have

[00:22:46] **Speaker**: something linear to wrap around which is

[00:22:47] **Speaker**: the tree limbs and branches okay we'll

[00:22:51] **Speaker**: come back to that again

[00:22:53] **Speaker**: okay

[00:22:54] **Speaker**: so

[00:22:56] **Speaker**: I guess

[00:22:57] **Speaker**: um my assistant can help me here
okay 
[00:23:10] **Speaker**: oh
now 
[00:23:16] **Speaker**: Sunshine is a Baja

[00:23:19] **Speaker**: which is a religion

[00:23:22] **Speaker**: I want that same religion

[00:23:25] **Speaker**: and because I never

[00:23:28] **Speaker**: undertalk an audience

[00:23:32] **Speaker**: that is the most great name of God that

[00:23:35] **Speaker**: is a symbol that's God's petroglyph in

[00:23:38] **Speaker**: other words well we were all doing our

[00:23:40] **Speaker**: own Petroglyph stuff Dodd was doing his

[00:23:42] **Speaker**: too

[00:23:44] **Speaker**: okay

[00:23:46] **Speaker**: and what was the purpose of our

[00:23:47] **Speaker**: petroglyphs but to essentially find the

[00:23:52] **Speaker**: the Supreme

[00:23:55] **Speaker**: the most great being

[00:23:58] **Speaker**: all coherent intelligence perfect brain

[00:24:00] **Speaker**: waves as Spock would say
so 
[00:24:07] **Speaker**: keep me from talking
let's just start 
[00:24:15] **Speaker**: I take a number archetypal value I say

[00:24:18] **Speaker**: four times one equals four four times

[00:24:20] **Speaker**: two equals eight four times uh 4 16 20

[00:24:25] **Speaker**: 24 28 32 36 everyone get that

[00:24:28] **Speaker**: very important for your math children

[00:24:31] **Speaker**: Judy okay

[00:24:33] **Speaker**: I then

[00:24:35] **Speaker**: I have another column of course over

[00:24:36] **Speaker**: here but I don't have these numbers I

[00:24:39] **Speaker**: have other funny numbers like 36 down

[00:24:41] **Speaker**: here I have a 9.

[00:24:42] **Speaker**: now where did that nine come from I cast

[00:24:45] **Speaker**: it out nice it also be

[00:24:47] **Speaker**: can be called cross Edition horizontal

[00:24:50] **Speaker**: math or summing

[00:24:51] **Speaker**: so I said three plus six equals nine

[00:24:55] **Speaker**: okay

[00:24:56] **Speaker**: three plus two I found it's easier for
you to understand by going backwards and forwards so instead of starting down like this I'm going backwards it's 
[00:25:02] **Speaker**: really easy when you do things backwards

[00:25:03] **Speaker**: sometimes so three plus two equals five

[00:25:08] **Speaker**: right so I have a five now two plus

[00:25:12] **Speaker**: eight is ten one plus zero is one

[00:25:15] **Speaker**: twenty four six twenty is two sixteen is

[00:25:18] **Speaker**: seven twelve is three eight is eight and

[00:25:21] **Speaker**: four is four

[00:25:22] **Speaker**: so what I've done is I've archetypal

[00:25:24] **Speaker**: archetypal value it's hard to say word

[00:25:28] **Speaker**: okay

[00:25:29] **Speaker**: over here I'm calling it quantum

[00:25:31] **Speaker**: numerology of course 45 it still equals

[00:25:34] **Speaker**: nine that's not by accident

[00:25:36] **Speaker**: here we have 40 is 4. 35 is 8 30 is 3 25

[00:25:41] **Speaker**: is 7.

[00:25:43] **Speaker**: and here I'm saying Telltale name

[00:25:45] **Speaker**: numbers

[00:25:46] **Speaker**: hope background code doesn't sue me for

[00:25:49] **Speaker**: this

[00:25:50] **Speaker**: taking his title

[00:25:53] **Speaker**: um and I actually take the

[00:25:55] **Speaker**: multiplication table and reduced it from

[00:25:58] **Speaker**: standard multiplication table

[00:26:01] **Speaker**: to a very simple multiplication table I

[00:26:04] **Speaker**: call the kids multiplication table

[00:26:07] **Speaker**: okay

[00:26:08] **Speaker**: um here I say zero is not a member of

[00:26:10] **Speaker**: any multiplication series here I'm

[00:26:12] **Speaker**: saying preferred frame of reference

[00:26:13] **Speaker**: explain through number patterns a little

[00:26:15] **Speaker**: too deep right now I also say time and

[00:26:17] **Speaker**: frequency too deep right now

[00:26:21] **Speaker**: we were talking about time before we

[00:26:23] **Speaker**: started

[00:26:24] **Speaker**: and um

[00:26:26] **Speaker**: and we used to think of Leon Russell as

[00:26:28] **Speaker**: the master of time space and reality

[00:26:31] **Speaker**: and um

[00:26:33] **Speaker**: what I have done is I've actually

[00:26:37] **Speaker**: got a Hands-On grip of time

[00:26:39] **Speaker**: okay

[00:26:41] **Speaker**: time to me is um

[00:26:49] **Speaker**: is a phasing a sequence order
is a 
[00:26:57] **Speaker**: is

[00:26:59] **Speaker**: what Charlie is referring to

[00:27:02] **Speaker**: as
how do we say it again the invisible 
[00:27:06] **Speaker**: energy

[00:27:07] **Speaker**: the uh the linearity

[00:27:10] **Speaker**: our world of time

[00:27:12] **Speaker**: does not have any linearity we try to
think in time as a as a continuous 
[00:27:18] **Speaker**: sequence

[00:27:19] **Speaker**: uh that's a straight line time is not

[00:27:22] **Speaker**: discreet in our physical world of math
that's why I have so much trouble 
[00:27:25] **Speaker**: functioning as human beings because in

[00:27:27] **Speaker**: our mind time is great in the higher

[00:27:29] **Speaker**: Dimensions which are mind occupied time

[00:27:31] **Speaker**: is straight time follows a logarithmic

[00:27:35] **Speaker**: spiral of infinity and this is the

[00:27:38] **Speaker**: pathway that time takes okay and this

[00:27:41] **Speaker**: chart is going to explain
time 
[00:27:46] **Speaker**: okay so let's follow the pathway of time

[00:27:49] **Speaker**: we have a circle this is supposed to be

[00:27:52] **Speaker**: round

[00:27:53] **Speaker**: unfortunately though

[00:27:55] **Speaker**: um

[00:27:56] **Speaker**: it was very hard for me to make round

[00:28:00] **Speaker**: so

[00:28:03] **Speaker**: it doesn't look round but it is it's

[00:28:05] **Speaker**: called The Circle of Life

[00:28:07] **Speaker**: it would more correctly

[00:28:09] **Speaker**: look like this

[00:28:13] **Speaker**: I guess I can probably set it over here

[00:28:20] **Speaker**: you guys speak real loud

[00:28:26] **Speaker**: this one

[00:28:28] **Speaker**: you know that

[00:28:32] **Speaker**: but that not Syrian knots and how women
do their knots and their hairs in certain cultures and all different 
[00:28:38] **Speaker**: things you're right that's exactly this

[00:28:39] **Speaker**: field it's also called uh
um 
[00:28:46] **Speaker**: forget what it's called has to do with

[00:28:48] **Speaker**: um climb bottles

[00:28:50] **Speaker**: what's it called stretch Mobius strip

[00:28:53] **Speaker**: but there's a word for it
yeah 
[00:29:00] **Speaker**: you gotta speak loud lemna the lemon

[00:29:03] **Speaker**: Escape is a what we always see is

[00:29:06] **Speaker**: infinity

[00:29:08] **Speaker**: rounded if you're taking Corners out of

[00:29:10] **Speaker**: that that's a good benefit and I brought

[00:29:12] **Speaker**: back in when I brought back in what my

[00:29:15] **Speaker**: contribution is I brought in the

[00:29:17] **Speaker**: intersection points I brought in The

[00:29:19] **Speaker**: Matrix to it so we can it's called the

[00:29:20] **Speaker**: underpinning geometry of the universe

[00:29:22] **Speaker**: it's real important because if you can

[00:29:24] **Speaker**: have a a lattice structure which is what

[00:29:27] **Speaker**: this is showing interferometry pattern
see how it gets bigger and smaller these little whole screens but they make 
[00:29:32] **Speaker**: bigger patterns with overlapping stuff

[00:29:34] **Speaker**: and you can actually scale it from

[00:29:36] **Speaker**: microscopic to microscopic to Infinity

[00:29:38] **Speaker**: you can it's called Uh fractals or

[00:29:42] **Speaker**: self-similar growth a recursive

[00:29:45] **Speaker**: scrolling

[00:29:47] **Speaker**: uh it's essentially a
a 
[00:29:53] **Speaker**: moire pattern

[00:29:55] **Speaker**: it's the secret of how everything works

[00:29:57] **Speaker**: this circle this shape in here and the

[00:30:00] **Speaker**: corners and stuff

[00:30:02] **Speaker**: is what I want you to be experts on we

[00:30:04] **Speaker**: have three elements

[00:30:06] **Speaker**: we have the infinity symbol the lazy

[00:30:08] **Speaker**: eight

[00:30:09] **Speaker**: we have the green element which is the

[00:30:14] **Speaker**: pyramid that's safe does not connect on

[00:30:17] **Speaker**: the base it connects at the top that's

[00:30:19] **Speaker**: very important because it's a vector and

[00:30:22] **Speaker**: I have the gold right here this is the

[00:30:25] **Speaker**: emanation coming out of the center

[00:30:27] **Speaker**: okay which is the Primal point of unity

[00:30:29] **Speaker**: is zero where and when why do I call

[00:30:32] **Speaker**: this Easter eggs why do I call it cookie

[00:30:34] **Speaker**: crumbs

[00:30:35] **Speaker**: why do I say well the bounds in Infinity

[00:30:38] **Speaker**: is what this is

[00:30:40] **Speaker**: numbers are real because I'm about to

[00:30:42] **Speaker**: show you when we do a computer program

[00:30:44] **Speaker**: Godly I mean the programmers leave us

[00:30:46] **Speaker**: little messages if we are lucky enough

[00:30:48] **Speaker**: to find them God left us big messages

[00:30:53] **Speaker**: okay these are what are called the signs

[00:30:56] **Speaker**: and attributes

[00:30:58] **Speaker**: okay everyone's still with me

[00:31:01] **Speaker**: okay

[00:31:02] **Speaker**: so we count on a circumference one two

[00:31:05] **Speaker**: three four five six seven eight nine

[00:31:07] **Speaker**: okay but as I already said

[00:31:10] **Speaker**: time on the third dimension moves in a

[00:31:14] **Speaker**: spiral

[00:31:15] **Speaker**: and it does not move linearly

[00:31:18] **Speaker**: so I'm going to show you and everything

[00:31:20] **Speaker**: starts from the inside out in creation

[00:31:22] **Speaker**: everything inside out arose inside out

[00:31:25] **Speaker**: so I'm we're going to now stick on time

[00:31:27] **Speaker**: though and we're going to follow the

[00:31:28] **Speaker**: pathway of time in our physical world

[00:31:31] **Speaker**: Third Dimension curving more universe

[00:31:34] **Speaker**: number one we have no trouble with one

[00:31:37] **Speaker**: God one universe

[00:31:39] **Speaker**: what does it do it doubles to two

[00:31:44] **Speaker**: what is two though it doubles to four

[00:31:46] **Speaker**: well that's definitely how things work

[00:31:47] **Speaker**: on our universe we have four cells eight

[00:31:49] **Speaker**: cells and conception when we're

[00:31:51] **Speaker**: conceived then we have 16 32 64.

[00:31:57] **Speaker**: 128 256 no trouble

[00:32:00] **Speaker**: okay

[00:32:01] **Speaker**: now four doubled and becomes eight okay

[00:32:06] **Speaker**: and eight doubles and becomes

[00:32:09] **Speaker**: 16.

[00:32:11] **Speaker**: okay now these charts I'm covering up

[00:32:14] **Speaker**: we're going to be coming back to so you

[00:32:16] **Speaker**: don't have to be concerned if you didn't

[00:32:17] **Speaker**: see all the information I'm going to

[00:32:19] **Speaker**: actually reverse my path as well

[00:32:22] **Speaker**: so sure enough I want one two four eight

[00:32:24] **Speaker**: sixteen

[00:32:25] **Speaker**: but on our Circle here we still have a

[00:32:28] **Speaker**: 7. we see our seven over here
okay 
[00:32:34] **Speaker**: um

[00:32:36] **Speaker**: now where did I get that seven from I

[00:32:39] **Speaker**: said one plus six equals seven

[00:32:41] **Speaker**: no problem

[00:32:44] **Speaker**: as Aleister said he said like I'm going

[00:32:46] **Speaker**: to repeat this what are you saying

[00:32:48] **Speaker**: numerology is the something something

[00:32:56] **Speaker**: we got he isn't that's the problem with

[00:32:58] **Speaker**: life we hear all this great stuff

[00:33:02] **Speaker**: right
it's also interesting 
[00:33:11] **Speaker**: here when you divide 9 into 16 you get

[00:33:14] **Speaker**: seven is the remainder it's how many

[00:33:16] **Speaker**: you've gone over one more time into 16

[00:33:20] **Speaker**: you get one and seven seven left over

[00:33:24] **Speaker**: right yeah taking a model right you're

[00:33:26] **Speaker**: taking you're doing mod nine arithmetic

[00:33:28] **Speaker**: actually 16 divided by nine equals what

[00:33:31] **Speaker**: equals one with remainder seven

[00:33:35] **Speaker**: no it can't be oh yeah because 16 is one

[00:33:38] **Speaker**: plus six is seven right oh one remainder

[00:33:41] **Speaker**: seven you're looking at the remainder

[00:33:43] **Speaker**: another way to look at what you're doing

[00:33:44] **Speaker**: is to look at the remainder oh this is

[00:33:46] **Speaker**: casting out nines you're casting out how

[00:33:48] **Speaker**: many times nine went into it and you're

[00:33:50] **Speaker**: looking at the number that's left over

[00:33:52] **Speaker**: so it's as if we say 12 o'clock and we

[00:33:55] **Speaker**: say one o'clock instead of 13 o'clock

[00:33:57] **Speaker**: because we're starting from zero over

[00:33:59] **Speaker**: three yeah we're going we're going just

[00:34:02] **Speaker**: like you said we're going

[00:34:04] **Speaker**: one two three four five six seven eight

[00:34:06] **Speaker**: nine and then this is ten one plus zero

[00:34:09] **Speaker**: is one eleven one is

[00:34:11] **Speaker**: ten you get one left over so it's the

[00:34:14] **Speaker**: excess of going around the clock once

[00:34:16] **Speaker**: like Barney's going to be very thankful

[00:34:18] **Speaker**: he's our host and he's we've been trying

[00:34:21] **Speaker**: to get somebody to explain it clearly

[00:34:23] **Speaker**: and you just did it for us yeah so when

[00:34:24] **Speaker**: you're divided it turns out with that

[00:34:26] **Speaker**: you can just add the number the digits

[00:34:28] **Speaker**: together and do your uh mod 9 and then

[00:34:30] **Speaker**: to pick that way am I adding them

[00:34:32] **Speaker**: together by adding one and six you'd get

[00:34:34] **Speaker**: the same as if you divide it right nine

[00:34:37] **Speaker**: into 16 and you look at the remaining it

[00:34:39] **Speaker**: works

[00:34:40] **Speaker**: it's not too hard to show that either

[00:34:42] **Speaker**: right automatically

[00:34:44] **Speaker**: all right and you just did it real well

[00:34:46] **Speaker**: thanks

[00:34:48] **Speaker**: so so the reason I'm reducing these to

[00:34:51] **Speaker**: single digit numbers for you everybody

[00:34:53] **Speaker**: is because I'm going to show you how to

[00:34:55] **Speaker**: look at time I can explain more about

[00:34:57] **Speaker**: going to be short work

[00:35:00] **Speaker**: so 16 doubled is 32.

[00:35:04] **Speaker**: and I really mean c time and I say look

[00:35:06] **Speaker**: everything I'm saying I mean literally

[00:35:09] **Speaker**: and 3 plus 2 is 5. everyone following up

[00:35:13] **Speaker**: this is a steel rail you must stay on it

[00:35:17] **Speaker**: it's a train track you can't go off it

[00:35:19] **Speaker**: okay now 32 double to 64 and 6 and 4 is

[00:35:24] **Speaker**: 10 is 1. back to one 128 11 2 256 13 4 5

[00:35:31] **Speaker**: 12 8 1024 7.

[00:35:35] **Speaker**: etc those one definitely of course

[00:35:38] **Speaker**: everyone follow that

[00:35:40] **Speaker**: remember I'm trying to show you how from

[00:35:43] **Speaker**: the inside it crosses the axis that

[00:35:46] **Speaker**: there's that it's very important that

[00:35:49] **Speaker**: I'm trying to show you there's something
inside it there's something in the middle okay 
[00:35:54] **Speaker**: no one's ever been able to see this

[00:35:55] **Speaker**: inside the middle before okay

[00:36:00] **Speaker**: okay

[00:36:02] **Speaker**: now um

[00:36:16] **Speaker**: assistant Judy please

[00:36:29] **Speaker**: assistance

[00:36:31] **Speaker**: I need the Easter eggs

[00:36:37] **Speaker**: would you please while I'm explaining

[00:36:39] **Speaker**: this

[00:36:41] **Speaker**: take out one Easter egg

[00:36:43] **Speaker**: anyone you want okay
there you have 
[00:36:53] **Speaker**: okay

[00:36:54] **Speaker**: it goes together right

[00:36:58] **Speaker**: you guys like Easter eggs yeah

[00:37:08] **Speaker**: there's uh there's nothing in them I've

[00:37:11] **Speaker**: been trying for weeks or three hours

[00:37:16] **Speaker**: oh crystals there we go that's a

[00:37:20] **Speaker**: good recommendation

[00:37:22] **Speaker**: okay I just flipped the chart oops too
soon for this one 
[00:37:27] **Speaker**: it's okay to be soft though

[00:37:31] **Speaker**: no point in having your mind race ahead

[00:37:35] **Speaker**: though

[00:37:36] **Speaker**: because the secret is is we gotta be

[00:37:39] **Speaker**: calm

[00:37:40] **Speaker**: cool and Collective and we can
assimilate better 
[00:37:48] **Speaker**: relax as we can be
relax 
[00:37:58] **Speaker**: okay here we have

[00:38:01] **Speaker**: going backwards we see that the one

[00:38:04] **Speaker**: connects to the five

[00:38:05] **Speaker**: okay

[00:38:07] **Speaker**: so we're going to go backwards instead

[00:38:09] **Speaker**: so a half of one is point five

[00:38:14] **Speaker**: a half of 0.5 depending there's a five

[00:38:17] **Speaker**: and I think of five and a half of 0.5 is

[00:38:20] **Speaker**: 0.25

[00:38:22] **Speaker**: but two plus five equals seven

[00:38:26] **Speaker**: this is where it starts to suddenly hit

[00:38:28] **Speaker**: home that you're about that you see that

[00:38:31] **Speaker**: I really am in Perfection when I say

[00:38:33] **Speaker**: perfection and what water is there what
does Perfection mean in your life this is when it starts getting personal to 
[00:38:39] **Speaker**: you

[00:38:39] **Speaker**: and when you start taking it

[00:38:43] **Speaker**: internally

[00:38:46] **Speaker**: okay so now Point 25

[00:38:49] **Speaker**: is at 0.5 is a half a point 25 and 20 25

[00:38:53] **Speaker**: half of that is 0.125 well one plus two

[00:38:56] **Speaker**: plus five equals an eight still

[00:38:59] **Speaker**: these numbers are never changing they're

[00:39:01] **Speaker**: never moving

[00:39:03] **Speaker**: a half a point 125 equals 0.0625

[00:39:08] **Speaker**: which equals 13 which equals 4.

[00:39:11] **Speaker**: half a 0.0625 equals 0.03125 which

[00:39:14] **Speaker**: equals 11 which equals two equals

[00:39:17] **Speaker**: 0.01625 so half of this again which is
one and I can't say the numbers after 
[00:39:21] **Speaker**: that I'm not going to try because this
isn't too long 
[00:39:27] **Speaker**: does everyone understand that so far all
I was doing was happening um 
[00:39:42] **Speaker**: our end goal is to explain eternity

[00:39:46] **Speaker**: because Eternal eternity is that
linearity 
[00:39:51] **Speaker**: this emanation

[00:39:53] **Speaker**: is eternal it's the light of Eternity

[00:39:56] **Speaker**: and that's we talk about in our Aura we

[00:39:59] **Speaker**: talk about in the radiance of good

[00:40:00] **Speaker**: health we call it Kana Chi orgone spirit

[00:40:06] **Speaker**: Indians have many names for it that's

[00:40:08] **Speaker**: Timeless though isn't it no that that

[00:40:11] **Speaker**: 404 at least it's Timeless in this well

[00:40:14] **Speaker**: I'm picturing it this way correctly

[00:40:17] **Speaker**: picture it as actually I was wrong for

[00:40:20] **Speaker**: saying though out of the plane of the

[00:40:23] **Speaker**: circuit of um of time it comes with the

[00:40:26] **Speaker**: perpendicular and the intersection with

[00:40:29] **Speaker**: the time is what we're seeing there but

[00:40:32] **Speaker**: it actually becomes perpendicularly now

[00:40:34] **Speaker**: okay so in that sense it's dimensionless

[00:40:38] **Speaker**: only except when it intersects the

[00:40:41] **Speaker**: totally correct

[00:40:44] **Speaker**: pretty heavy duty huh

[00:40:46] **Speaker**: yeah

[00:40:47] **Speaker**: I call it omelette that's why I say it's

[00:40:49] **Speaker**: hard to talk about linearity because we

[00:40:51] **Speaker**: think linearity is three-dimension and

[00:40:53] **Speaker**: without really out of out of the

[00:40:56] **Speaker**: dimension of 3DS I suffered walking down

[00:40:58] **Speaker**: the halls and you still later you should

[00:41:00] **Speaker**: be going to to linear science I go to

[00:41:03] **Speaker**: the professors of linear science and

[00:41:05] **Speaker**: they don't all have everything is

[00:41:06] **Speaker**: curvature and I'm saying what's going on

[00:41:08] **Speaker**: here

[00:41:10] **Speaker**: I they they don't even use the terms but

[00:41:12] **Speaker**: we're still modeling that in terms of

[00:41:14] **Speaker**: what we see every day and and we're

[00:41:17] **Speaker**: using models it's very hard for you to

[00:41:19] **Speaker**: think that because it's it's beyond our

[00:41:21] **Speaker**: perception I was like 17 or 18 and I

[00:41:24] **Speaker**: just said

[00:41:26] **Speaker**: the name on the door doesn't match in
the science building with the math 
[00:41:30] **Speaker**: department with when they're saying

[00:41:31] **Speaker**: linear science linear mathematics I said

[00:41:33] **Speaker**: where's the linear
they're talking about 
[00:41:37] **Speaker**: totally
yeah 
[00:41:41] **Speaker**: what he just said

[00:41:43] **Speaker**: was that this energy going out is online

[00:41:47] **Speaker**: dimensional the only thing that can

[00:41:49] **Speaker**: happen analogy for it is the queen on a

[00:41:52] **Speaker**: chessboard you know the old King he's

[00:41:54] **Speaker**: really straddled just one little step at

[00:41:56] **Speaker**: a time he's definitely hindered okay but

[00:42:01] **Speaker**: uh our duke or a king or a castle they

[00:42:05] **Speaker**: move certain ways but the queen can move

[00:42:08] **Speaker**: diagonally horizontally vertically she

[00:42:11] **Speaker**: moves any way she wants she defines

[00:42:13] **Speaker**: defines the whole game she's our most

[00:42:15] **Speaker**: prized piece in the game of chess

[00:42:18] **Speaker**: okay yes Judy

[00:42:21] **Speaker**: to say this but um

[00:42:25] **Speaker**: in my mind

[00:42:28] **Speaker**: God and man

[00:42:30] **Speaker**: and then the spirit of God

[00:42:32] **Speaker**: and the spirit of God is good

[00:42:35] **Speaker**: the energy or action or the life of path

[00:42:40] **Speaker**: from God

[00:42:41] **Speaker**: that connects us is the spirit of God

[00:42:45] **Speaker**: I want to go with that word the holy

[00:42:47] **Speaker**: spirit

[00:42:49] **Speaker**: is coming but if you want to be classy

[00:42:52] **Speaker**: you can call it a Theta particle tachyon

[00:42:54] **Speaker**: why not graviton uh

[00:42:57] **Speaker**: monopole is fine

[00:43:01] **Speaker**: that's what that is it is the glue that
holds the universe together sometimes 
[00:43:05] **Speaker**: you call it you know what you call

[00:43:06] **Speaker**: sometimes people call it love

[00:43:09] **Speaker**: okay it's the um

[00:43:14] **Speaker**: you know it's the observer in the

[00:43:16] **Speaker**: subatomic it's it's omnipotent

[00:43:19] **Speaker**: omniscient all observing it is God's

[00:43:22] **Speaker**: neurons it is how he is seeing us no

[00:43:26] **Speaker**: matter what we're doing at all times in

[00:43:27] **Speaker**: all places all the time

[00:43:29] **Speaker**: it's how he keeps us on a Leash too but

[00:43:32] **Speaker**: that's a little heavy duty

[00:43:36] **Speaker**: and it can't be what

[00:43:38] **Speaker**: you know the the teacher

[00:43:43] **Speaker**: the witness that we are that we we have

[00:43:46] **Speaker**: a witness that

[00:43:48] **Speaker**: um that's right everything we do is

[00:43:50] **Speaker**: inscribed in Christian life because of

[00:43:52] **Speaker**: it that's right there is just like in

[00:43:54] **Speaker**: zardas everything that people did had a

[00:43:57] **Speaker**: little Crystal going through their brain

[00:43:58] **Speaker**: and it was preserved and when their body

[00:44:00] **Speaker**: died they were just reinvented if they

[00:44:01] **Speaker**: broke any of the laws it just aged them

[00:44:03] **Speaker**: and if they were really bad they were

[00:44:05] **Speaker**: banished to uh the endless old people's

[00:44:08] **Speaker**: Ballroom

[00:44:10] **Speaker**: you remember that

[00:44:12] **Speaker**: it's an old movie no one knows

[00:44:16] **Speaker**: well you know I live in Beverly Hills
and you know got to the point what can 
[00:44:20] **Speaker**: you do and they're always looking for

[00:44:21] **Speaker**: unusual things there and so Sean Connery

[00:44:25] **Speaker**: played the league came out

[00:44:27] **Speaker**: he was a super Advanced uh

[00:44:30] **Speaker**: uh he was done genetically engineered to

[00:44:33] **Speaker**: an advanced being that the this Advanced

[00:44:36] **Speaker**: civilization of mankind one of them was

[00:44:38] **Speaker**: broken the laws they all wanted to die

[00:44:40] **Speaker**: because this Crystal was preserving

[00:44:42] **Speaker**: everything they were so he invented this

[00:44:44] **Speaker**: most advanced man on the planet so he

[00:44:47] **Speaker**: would kill them all and destroy their

[00:44:49] **Speaker**: civilization so he could die

[00:44:51] **Speaker**: um because everything was always

[00:44:52] **Speaker**: preserved so um so Sean Connery played

[00:44:56] **Speaker**: this this being that had total mind

[00:45:00] **Speaker**: control and
um 
[00:45:05] **Speaker**: he could control his emotions and

[00:45:07] **Speaker**: feelings and um

[00:45:09] **Speaker**: and he essentially it was a real fun

[00:45:11] **Speaker**: movie it was my kind of movie because it

[00:45:13] **Speaker**: was a parody and a satire and a humor
based on 
[00:45:18] **Speaker**: um

[00:45:19] **Speaker**: technology as being the solution to our

[00:45:26] **Speaker**: requirements so it was like a

[00:45:28] **Speaker**: government-controlled Karma crystal

[00:45:29] **Speaker**: that's exactly what it was you got it

[00:45:32] **Speaker**: exactly right

[00:45:33] **Speaker**: government controller Karma Krista get
into the world ideas 
[00:45:39] **Speaker**: okay

[00:45:41] **Speaker**: um
so um 
[00:45:48] **Speaker**: on since I said the word technology

[00:45:51] **Speaker**: I have a saying numbers are technology

[00:45:56] **Speaker**: okay math is a science

[00:45:59] **Speaker**: and um

[00:46:02] **Speaker**: and the universe is a machine

[00:46:06] **Speaker**: and spirit

[00:46:08] **Speaker**: is mechanical

[00:46:12] **Speaker**: um when we talk about God we talk about

[00:46:15] **Speaker**: Spirit we talk about human beings

[00:46:21] **Speaker**: um

[00:46:23] **Speaker**: we try to

[00:46:25] **Speaker**: not get

[00:46:27] **Speaker**: our head guillotined cut off by

[00:46:32] **Speaker**: um

[00:46:33] **Speaker**: offending

[00:46:35] **Speaker**: the infrastructure the hierarchical

[00:46:38] **Speaker**: society institutions and governments

[00:46:43] **Speaker**: corporations

[00:46:44] **Speaker**: in the case here

[00:46:48] **Speaker**: the fact is is that spirit

[00:46:53] **Speaker**: is harnessing

[00:46:56] **Speaker**: it can be used as a work wheel

[00:46:59] **Speaker**: it is actually

[00:47:03] **Speaker**: a source of drive that can be made into

[00:47:06] **Speaker**: an engine

[00:47:08] **Speaker**: and it's the it's the energy that God

[00:47:12] **Speaker**: used to create our universe our

[00:47:16] **Speaker**: cosmology and universe means one there's

[00:47:17] **Speaker**: only one universe and that's the world

[00:47:19] **Speaker**: of creation it's many worlds within this

[00:47:21] **Speaker**: world but there's only one physical

[00:47:22] **Speaker**: world of creation

[00:47:24] **Speaker**: and um

[00:47:27] **Speaker**: we'll go on I'll come back to it now we

[00:47:31] **Speaker**: saw this again by 25.125

[00:47:36] **Speaker**: so

[00:47:37] **Speaker**: let's take a look at

[00:47:43] **Speaker**: let's see

[00:47:44] **Speaker**: this chart here

[00:47:55] **Speaker**: may fall but that's all right

[00:48:06] **Speaker**: um

[00:48:08] **Speaker**: the powers of 10.
come 
[00:48:12] **Speaker**: from

[00:48:13] **Speaker**: half of one is point five that would be

[00:48:16] **Speaker**: one over one by the way correct one line

[00:48:19] **Speaker**: one

[00:48:20] **Speaker**: this would be five over ten okay so the

[00:48:25] **Speaker**: 10 goes there

[00:48:27] **Speaker**: this would be 25 line 100.

[00:48:33] **Speaker**: 100 would go there

[00:48:34] **Speaker**: this would be 125 thousandths

[00:48:39] **Speaker**: okay so we have now

[00:48:42] **Speaker**: 625 ten thousands three thousand one

[00:48:45] **Speaker**: hundred twenty five hundred thousands

[00:48:47] **Speaker**: this is called the powers of ten y times

[00:48:50] **Speaker**: ten is ten times a hundred ten times 100

[00:48:52] **Speaker**: is a thousand ten times a thousand is

[00:48:55] **Speaker**: ten thousand

[00:48:57] **Speaker**: hundred thousand million 10 million

[00:49:00] **Speaker**: hundred thousand one billion ten billion

[00:49:03] **Speaker**: 100 billion a trillion everyone have it
okay 
[00:49:16] **Speaker**: now uh

[00:49:21] **Speaker**: with the 10 right there

[00:49:24] **Speaker**: the third time that the 10 we occurs

[00:49:27] **Speaker**: again is exactly horizontal

[00:49:30] **Speaker**: but it had to go one two three

[00:49:34] **Speaker**: to re-emerge again

[00:49:36] **Speaker**: this energy has a phasing in thirds

[00:49:40] **Speaker**: what I just did Sunshine interesting you

[00:49:45] **Speaker**: could hear it oh good

[00:49:47] **Speaker**: okay so the tens are horizontally lining

[00:49:51] **Speaker**: up these are horizontally line up and

[00:49:53] **Speaker**: these are horizontal alignment why

[00:49:55] **Speaker**: because there's a spray

[00:49:57] **Speaker**: okay shooting out from the center

[00:50:00] **Speaker**: this is a sprayer they're like little

[00:50:02] **Speaker**: babies okay
um 
[00:50:10] **Speaker**: we see the points here our mirrors
they're subtly different than these two and totally different from these are 
[00:50:15] **Speaker**: just as the tens are different from the

[00:50:17] **Speaker**: hundreds or different from the ones

[00:50:20] **Speaker**: okay so in our Infinity we have three

[00:50:24] **Speaker**: horizontal lining UPS of three pairs

[00:50:26] **Speaker**: with each pair being totally different

[00:50:28] **Speaker**: from the other pairs does everyone see

[00:50:31] **Speaker**: that these pairs are kind of deep in the
inside these are way on the outside 
[00:50:34] **Speaker**: these are kind of in the middle

[00:50:36] **Speaker**: okay because of the sprays making that

[00:50:39] **Speaker**: shape that construct we see that tens
are always here we see that hundreds are 
[00:50:43] **Speaker**: always here the ones are always here no

[00:50:45] **Speaker**: matter what here's a million here's a

[00:50:47] **Speaker**: billion

[00:50:48] **Speaker**: they're always going to still be ones

[00:50:51] **Speaker**: okay

[00:50:52] **Speaker**: now this is a geometry

[00:50:55] **Speaker**: and in science and math today they teach
that numbers 
[00:51:03] **Speaker**: as an arithmetic

[00:51:05] **Speaker**: cannot explain geometry

[00:51:10] **Speaker**: and I discovered they were wrong I

[00:51:13] **Speaker**: discovered that numbers

[00:51:15] **Speaker**: are geometry they are numbers are not

[00:51:18] **Speaker**: modeling something they are the model

[00:51:20] **Speaker**: themselves it's a real big Discovery it

[00:51:24] **Speaker**: means that

[00:51:25] **Speaker**: five billion people

[00:51:27] **Speaker**: with flunk math

[00:51:31] **Speaker**: okay

[00:51:33] **Speaker**: the only problem is is if these two

[00:51:36] **Speaker**: points are perfect mirrors there's an
axis down the center everything's a 
[00:51:39] **Speaker**: mirroring right and left it's called

[00:51:40] **Speaker**: bilateral symmetry then what do we do

[00:51:42] **Speaker**: with the one and eight since they're not

[00:51:44] **Speaker**: mirrors or the two and seven since
they're not here so the four and five 
[00:51:48] **Speaker**: since they're not near
okay well 
[00:52:06] **Speaker**: did we throw out the whole system

[00:52:10] **Speaker**: did we say that we finally found

[00:52:12] **Speaker**: something that was incorrect In My

[00:52:13] **Speaker**: Discovery that mathematically

[00:52:17] **Speaker**: it's obsolete already

[00:52:22] **Speaker**: we challenge it to the maximum any error

[00:52:25] **Speaker**: any mistake anywhere in it any

[00:52:26] **Speaker**: incongruity we rip and tear this thing

[00:52:29] **Speaker**: apart

[00:52:30] **Speaker**: and we find out

[00:52:32] **Speaker**: where that error and what that is and if

[00:52:34] **Speaker**: it's really wrong

[00:52:36] **Speaker**: so the only way I can do that

[00:52:39] **Speaker**: is I go ahead and I say well where's our

[00:52:41] **Speaker**: symmetry that I've been talking about

[00:52:42] **Speaker**: where's our parity where's our mirroring

[00:52:45] **Speaker**: where's our wings

[00:52:46] **Speaker**: see how the right side over here is a

[00:52:48] **Speaker**: perfect mirror they're like two Wings on

[00:52:50] **Speaker**: a bird fine

[00:52:52] **Speaker**: where is it

[00:52:54] **Speaker**: so I take our multiples of one from the

[00:52:57] **Speaker**: standard multiplication table I reduce

[00:52:58] **Speaker**: them to single digit which I call the

[00:53:00] **Speaker**: kids multiplication table using

[00:53:02] **Speaker**: horizontal math

[00:53:03] **Speaker**: and I look at the Symmetry well

[00:53:05] **Speaker**: multiples of one is one two three four

[00:53:07] **Speaker**: five six seven eight nine well multiples

[00:53:09] **Speaker**: of eight is eight seven six five four

[00:53:11] **Speaker**: three two one nine I look at multiples

[00:53:13] **Speaker**: of of two two four six eight one three

[00:53:16] **Speaker**: five seven nine multiples of seven are

[00:53:18] **Speaker**: perfect near seven five three one eight

[00:53:19] **Speaker**: six four two nine I look at multiples of

[00:53:22] **Speaker**: a five and four four eight three seven

[00:53:25] **Speaker**: two six one five nine which is the total

[00:53:27] **Speaker**: reverse of five five one six two

[00:53:29] **Speaker**: everything's a mirror three is three six

[00:53:31] **Speaker**: nine three six nine six and six three

[00:53:32] **Speaker**: nine sixty nine put nine it's so similar

[00:53:35] **Speaker**: it's always nine nine nine nine so let's

[00:53:37] **Speaker**: see if that's true

[00:53:38] **Speaker**: so sure enough I go multiples of one is

[00:53:41] **Speaker**: one two three four five six seven eight

[00:53:46] **Speaker**: nine that means Eight's the last number

[00:53:48] **Speaker**: before nine I better have an eight over

[00:53:51] **Speaker**: here being a mirror of that eight and I

[00:53:53] **Speaker**: better have a seven after it but two

[00:53:55] **Speaker**: eighths is sixteen I'm writing them for

[00:53:57] **Speaker**: your benefit which is seven three eight

[00:54:00] **Speaker**: is twenty four there it is again which

[00:54:02] **Speaker**: is a six thirty two five forty four and

[00:54:06] **Speaker**: of course I got three two one nine after

[00:54:08] **Speaker**: it because once I got three numbers I

[00:54:10] **Speaker**: got a stereoscopic projection I know all

[00:54:11] **Speaker**: the remaining numbers are going to be at

[00:54:13] **Speaker**: the same sequence

[00:54:15] **Speaker**: perfect mirrors the real pleasure is

[00:54:18] **Speaker**: when I do it with two

[00:54:20] **Speaker**: two four six eight one three five seven

[00:54:24] **Speaker**: nine

[00:54:27] **Speaker**: okay which is seven five three one eight

[00:54:32] **Speaker**: six four two nine two sevenths is

[00:54:35] **Speaker**: fourteen which is five twenty one three

[00:54:37] **Speaker**: twenty eight ten one uh seven times five

[00:54:40] **Speaker**: is thirty five eight Etc forty two six

[00:54:43] **Speaker**: anyone follow that
statements anybody 
[00:54:54] **Speaker**: you like nine the number for the safe

[00:54:57] **Speaker**: you're playing it safe the number you

[00:55:00] **Speaker**: bring Apples to the teacher remember the

[00:55:02] **Speaker**: universe boys and girls is nine say it

[00:55:04] **Speaker**: again the number for the universe it

[00:55:05] **Speaker**: Sesame Street is nine in Sesame Street

[00:55:09] **Speaker**: I never saw someone well they always had

[00:55:11] **Speaker**: a number of the day this is the number

[00:55:13] **Speaker**: for the universe right oh yeah the

[00:55:15] **Speaker**: number for the universe is nine exactly

[00:55:17] **Speaker**: right in fact

[00:55:19] **Speaker**: the saying is

[00:55:21] **Speaker**: that the universe is created after nine
conditions 
[00:55:32] **Speaker**: so the universe has been created after

[00:55:34] **Speaker**: nine conditions what's a condition

[00:55:38] **Speaker**: we're going to find out what a number

[00:55:40] **Speaker**: what a condition is each number has its
own condition there's never any 
[00:55:45] **Speaker**: redundancy
okay 
[00:55:50] **Speaker**: um Judy says what about crimes

[00:55:52] **Speaker**: right

[00:55:54] **Speaker**: I think I think that's a little bit more

[00:55:56] **Speaker**: harder than it than for us to go into at

[00:55:58] **Speaker**: this moment but it totally

[00:56:00] **Speaker**: encompasses all primes and how they work

[00:56:03] **Speaker**: but I have bad news the definition for a

[00:56:05] **Speaker**: prime is not a true Prime would it work

[00:56:09] **Speaker**: in your

[00:56:10] **Speaker**: s this is this system is what creates

[00:56:14] **Speaker**: crimes

[00:56:15] **Speaker**: have you experimented

[00:56:20] **Speaker**: I

[00:56:21] **Speaker**: I have spent very little time on it I

[00:56:24] **Speaker**: went ahead and with primes I kind of

[00:56:27] **Speaker**: realized pretty fast that the

[00:56:29] **Speaker**: definitions here we have to have

[00:56:31] **Speaker**: conventional definitions for things so

[00:56:33] **Speaker**: we all can agree in different countries

[00:56:35] **Speaker**: and what we're working on and I

[00:56:37] **Speaker**: immediately realized as soon as I looked

[00:56:39] **Speaker**: at primes at the definition of primes

[00:56:40] **Speaker**: was false
um there's a lot more crimes than they 
[00:56:44] **Speaker**: were understanding

[00:56:45] **Speaker**: so I would so what I do is I I prefer to

[00:56:48] **Speaker**: tie this in one time so if we wanted to

[00:56:50] **Speaker**: just do a whole session on Primes

[00:56:54] **Speaker**: not a session even I would call it a

[00:56:57] **Speaker**: brainstorming together

[00:56:58] **Speaker**: to see about how to present primes then

[00:57:01] **Speaker**: we have to do it but I could never do

[00:57:03] **Speaker**: climbs alone I can't do any conventional

[00:57:06] **Speaker**: type of math alone I would have to take

[00:57:07] **Speaker**: both of your since you're both Math

[00:57:10] **Speaker**: teachers participation together working

[00:57:12] **Speaker**: with me and sharing because I haven't

[00:57:15] **Speaker**: learned the nomenclature of existing

[00:57:18] **Speaker**: math and one of the things I need

[00:57:20] **Speaker**: everything on a personal level so when I

[00:57:23] **Speaker**: study and learn the textbooks and stuff

[00:57:25] **Speaker**: if I don't have a friend there for when

[00:57:27] **Speaker**: I have a question I just kind of get

[00:57:29] **Speaker**: burnt down on it real fast

[00:57:31] **Speaker**: and uh

[00:57:34] **Speaker**: everyone

[00:57:36] **Speaker**: so where I was just a second ago

[00:57:40] **Speaker**: was I was going to show that numbers

[00:57:42] **Speaker**: have a fundamental quality

[00:57:45] **Speaker**: okay fancy languages is the fundamental

[00:57:48] **Speaker**: property characteristic number what's

[00:57:50] **Speaker**: the fundamental quality is that there's

[00:57:52] **Speaker**: no redundancy

[00:57:53] **Speaker**: meaning no no duplication of any quality

[00:57:57] **Speaker**: of the number and there's nothing

[00:57:58] **Speaker**: omitted nothing left out

[00:58:00] **Speaker**: it's real important it has to do with

[00:58:02] **Speaker**: Spirit again nothing that this energy is

[00:58:06] **Speaker**: complete

[00:58:07] **Speaker**: okay so let's look at that

[00:58:12] **Speaker**: everyone's going to have to kind of lean

[00:58:13] **Speaker**: over

[00:58:15] **Speaker**: right here on the floor

[00:58:18] **Speaker**: I have the multiplication series

[00:58:21] **Speaker**: okay

[00:58:22] **Speaker**: and I have one two three four five six

[00:58:25] **Speaker**: seven eight nine does everybody see it

[00:58:29] **Speaker**: okay now on the right over there

[00:58:32] **Speaker**: multiples of one is the mirrors of

[00:58:34] **Speaker**: multiples of eight

[00:58:35] **Speaker**: now we have a thing that I'm teaching

[00:58:37] **Speaker**: which is called the three family number

[00:58:38] **Speaker**: groups of numbers

[00:58:41] **Speaker**: um I might add that my end goal is that

[00:58:43] **Speaker**: if is today I have that I hope you don't

[00:58:47] **Speaker**: drop drop out and pass out by the time

[00:58:49] **Speaker**: we're done because my end goal is to

[00:58:52] **Speaker**: teach you what an ethernron spiral is

[00:58:53] **Speaker**: and nobody knows this stuff but me and

[00:58:56] **Speaker**: so it's kind of my responsibility to

[00:58:58] **Speaker**: cover this today because in all my other

[00:58:59] **Speaker**: talks I have not been able to address

[00:59:01] **Speaker**: this because it's just too complicated
yeah 
[00:59:14] **Speaker**: say that you gotta say it loud say it

[00:59:17] **Speaker**: real loud is that is that does it have

[00:59:19] **Speaker**: anything to do with because

[00:59:25] **Speaker**: at the doctor okay and the nine times

[00:59:29] **Speaker**: table when you teach children is always

[00:59:32] **Speaker**: with them

[00:59:33] **Speaker**: right nine times you know nine times two

[00:59:36] **Speaker**: is eighteen you know the whole thing was

[00:59:39] **Speaker**: nice does that have anything to do with

[00:59:41] **Speaker**: being human and being a creation and

[00:59:45] **Speaker**: yeah

[00:59:46] **Speaker**: the only problem is is we don't have ten

[00:59:48] **Speaker**: fingers okay

[00:59:51] **Speaker**: the reason we don't is because

[00:59:54] **Speaker**: my left hand

[00:59:56] **Speaker**: I hope I don't make a mess

[00:59:58] **Speaker**: by getting it all over me

[01:00:00] **Speaker**: okay that's my left

[01:00:09] **Speaker**: and that's my right
honestly 
[01:00:20] **Speaker**: by their thumbs
um 
[01:00:28] **Speaker**: I I love patterns Scrolls fingerprints

[01:00:31] **Speaker**: stuff like that

[01:00:33] **Speaker**: you know I love how this all connects

[01:00:36] **Speaker**: because it does connect all that
um 
[01:00:39] **Speaker**: the reason you don't have

[01:00:41] **Speaker**: ten fingers it's because it would be one

[01:00:44] **Speaker**: two three four five and that thumb would

[01:00:47] **Speaker**: not be there it would be over here and

[01:00:50] **Speaker**: it would be six seven eight nine ten

[01:00:52] **Speaker**: because these thumbs are posals they're

[01:00:55] **Speaker**: mirrors you have an axis this is your

[01:00:58] **Speaker**: axis you have bilateral symmetry where

[01:01:00] **Speaker**: the half is a mirror of the right you

[01:01:02] **Speaker**: know in the science museums if you stand

[01:01:04] **Speaker**: in front of the mirror it looks like

[01:01:06] **Speaker**: your whole person even half of you isn't

[01:01:07] **Speaker**: there though okay so what I showed

[01:01:10] **Speaker**: already was that by halfing was powers

[01:01:13] **Speaker**: of ten because the base 10 system the

[01:01:16] **Speaker**: decimal system does not have 10 numbers

[01:01:19] **Speaker**: how many numbers do we have we have nine

[01:01:21] **Speaker**: that's because zero is not a number it's

[01:01:25] **Speaker**: an absence

[01:01:26] **Speaker**: okay it is the hole in the vortex

[01:01:30] **Speaker**: okay we'll be seeing about that shortly

[01:01:34] **Speaker**: so thus any base system the base 10 is

[01:01:38] **Speaker**: always one number less than the number

[01:01:40] **Speaker**: of that base

[01:01:42] **Speaker**: thus the base 10 is modular 9. that's an

[01:01:45] **Speaker**: accepted

[01:01:46] **Speaker**: premise in all mathematics okay but what

[01:01:50] **Speaker**: I'm teaching about is three colors

[01:01:53] **Speaker**: I'm teaching about blue

[01:01:56] **Speaker**: I'm teaching about pink

[01:01:58] **Speaker**: I'm teaching about Green

[01:02:01] **Speaker**: these are called family number groups

[01:02:05] **Speaker**: a family number group there are three of

[01:02:07] **Speaker**: them is always separated by the number

[01:02:10] **Speaker**: three

[01:02:11] **Speaker**: or six see the three of six here

[01:02:14] **Speaker**: separating everything

[01:02:16] **Speaker**: and the nine two

[01:02:18] **Speaker**: everyone see that

[01:02:21] **Speaker**: the pink is all the same family member

[01:02:24] **Speaker**: group they're all the same color

[01:02:26] **Speaker**: one plus three is four four plus three

[01:02:30] **Speaker**: is seven and seven plus three is ten is

[01:02:32] **Speaker**: one

[01:02:33] **Speaker**: okay so you're back to one again you're

[01:02:35] **Speaker**: gonna have thirteen sixteen just going

[01:02:38] **Speaker**: to keep on repeating over and over again

[01:02:39] **Speaker**: what's important is what are these

[01:02:41] **Speaker**: family number groups are

[01:02:43] **Speaker**: occurring

[01:02:45] **Speaker**: it's like a monster it's like a rotary

[01:02:47] **Speaker**: car engine

[01:02:48] **Speaker**: you have a question well I just kind of
noticed something here I'm an astrologer so I guess 
[01:02:53] **Speaker**: other uh

[01:02:54] **Speaker**: things that each of the numbers signify

[01:02:57] **Speaker**: but I was seeing just in a Christian

[01:02:59] **Speaker**: anthology of three is like the Holy

[01:03:02] **Speaker**: Trinity and like the The Father's son

[01:03:06] **Speaker**: Holy Ghost and the sixth is like the you

[01:03:09] **Speaker**: know the 666 like the Earth Matrix

[01:03:14] **Speaker**: the bridge in between them
yeah 
[01:03:20] **Speaker**: I've never studied all these it's

[01:03:23] **Speaker**: interesting the connections are real

[01:03:32] **Speaker**: man man doing a 666 is trying to be God

[01:03:36] **Speaker**: which is not which is a chemical formula

[01:03:39] **Speaker**: for petroleum in the subscriptions
is is 
[01:03:59] **Speaker**: the sixth and Ninth

[01:04:04] **Speaker**: are they all connecting really well

[01:04:06] **Speaker**: they're connected to three six and nine

[01:04:08] **Speaker**: they connect with invisible nine yeah

[01:04:10] **Speaker**: yeah

[01:04:13] **Speaker**: um

[01:04:14] **Speaker**: I'm gonna really

[01:04:16] **Speaker**: drill you guys on three sixes and nines

[01:04:20] **Speaker**: the information they're gonna really be
put to work 
[01:04:24] **Speaker**: okay
so 
[01:04:29] **Speaker**: so three is a mirror of six so instead

[01:04:35] **Speaker**: of looking adding one plus three is four
four plus three seven we're going to do 
[01:04:39] **Speaker**: it backwards we're gonna go one plus six

[01:04:40] **Speaker**: but it's going to equal a seven seven

[01:04:43] **Speaker**: plus six is thirteen which is four and

[01:04:45] **Speaker**: four plus six is ten which is one

[01:04:49] **Speaker**: if I go fours with three so I can go

[01:04:51] **Speaker**: four backwards with sixes

[01:04:53] **Speaker**: do that again

[01:04:55] **Speaker**: okay

[01:04:57] **Speaker**: one plus six is seven

[01:05:01] **Speaker**: plus six is thirteen which is four

[01:05:04] **Speaker**: and four plus six is ten which is one

[01:05:08] **Speaker**: okay so three is one way and six is a

[01:05:13] **Speaker**: reverse way

[01:05:15] **Speaker**: okay

[01:05:17] **Speaker**: let's do two let's do Blues

[01:05:19] **Speaker**: two plus three is five five plus three

[01:05:23] **Speaker**: is eight eight plus three is eleven

[01:05:24] **Speaker**: which equals two

[01:05:26] **Speaker**: okay we can go backwards

[01:05:28] **Speaker**: two plus six is eight eight plus six is
five and five plus six is eleven which 
[01:05:32] **Speaker**: is two

[01:05:33] **Speaker**: so I don't know how to say it right but

[01:05:36] **Speaker**: somehow these are like the furthest most

[01:05:37] **Speaker**: extremes is how I tend to think of it

[01:05:39] **Speaker**: because they all goes somewhere

[01:05:45] **Speaker**: she's having an aha over here

[01:05:58] **Speaker**: if you can use a favorite movie I think

[01:06:01] **Speaker**: it's not a lot it's aloha

[01:06:31] **Speaker**: he used the big oscillate word yeah

[01:06:34] **Speaker**: that's the power

[01:06:36] **Speaker**: adjacent one plus two three two plus

[01:06:39] **Speaker**: four is six

[01:06:41] **Speaker**: they are oscillating

[01:06:43] **Speaker**: three yeah they are oscillating back and

[01:06:46] **Speaker**: forth they're heavy duty

[01:06:49] **Speaker**: okay you

[01:06:51] **Speaker**: never see the night it's always

[01:06:53] **Speaker**: invisible that's right that's that's the

[01:06:56] **Speaker**: power of this math because we don't have

[01:06:58] **Speaker**: it but it'll show it by the angle and

[01:07:01] **Speaker**: the ratio the displacement this energy

[01:07:05] **Speaker**: here is displacing everything see how

[01:07:08] **Speaker**: the green here matches the green here

[01:07:10] **Speaker**: okay but let's not go that far enough

[01:07:12] **Speaker**: like displacement like color

[01:07:15] **Speaker**: works right totally polarizes color this

[01:07:18] **Speaker**: is the color wheel

[01:07:19] **Speaker**: right and the music I don't know when it

[01:07:21] **Speaker**: but I know that I've heard it somewhere

[01:07:23] **Speaker**: where you know it's like whatever color

[01:07:26] **Speaker**: you're wearing it's actually the absence

[01:07:27] **Speaker**: of that color is what you've seen right

[01:07:29] **Speaker**: is that what it is

[01:07:33] **Speaker**: like black isn't really black black is
all the colors 
[01:07:44] **Speaker**: the white they always told me you can't
have white white 
[01:07:56] **Speaker**: pigment it's the exact opposite

[01:07:59] **Speaker**: see black and white are really the same
thing 
[01:08:05] **Speaker**: someone finally explained

[01:08:16] **Speaker**: I love artists with the high writings

[01:08:19] **Speaker**: they say artists have the greatest

[01:08:22] **Speaker**: encompassment over mankind not the

[01:08:25] **Speaker**: higher learning accidents but rather the

[01:08:27] **Speaker**: artists will be the ones who will

[01:08:29] **Speaker**: educate Mankind through Beauty saying is

[01:08:32] **Speaker**: artists the best beauty is the best

[01:08:34] **Speaker**: teacher and I believe that

[01:08:36] **Speaker**: um

[01:08:38] **Speaker**: okay

[01:08:40] **Speaker**: we were

[01:08:42] **Speaker**: we were brought by Charlie to the

[01:08:44] **Speaker**: oscillation of three and six and for the

[01:08:46] **Speaker**: PowerPoint there's no escaping now so

[01:08:48] **Speaker**: we'll do it three double the six

[01:08:51] **Speaker**: th of what is 12 which is three twelve

[01:08:54] **Speaker**: doubled is 24 which is six 24 doubles 48

[01:08:58] **Speaker**: which is 12 which is three constantly

[01:09:00] **Speaker**: oscillating never ends okay only one or

[01:09:03] **Speaker**: the other that's called movement back

[01:09:06] **Speaker**: and forth this Duality is called what

[01:09:07] **Speaker**: the yin and yang correct okay if you

[01:09:11] **Speaker**: have the yin and yang on your shirt

[01:09:12] **Speaker**: there all right

[01:09:16] **Speaker**: so what you've done when you have

[01:09:19] **Speaker**: symmetry when you drop the

[01:09:21] **Speaker**: you drop the top off
is off 
[01:09:26] **Speaker**: top what the knife no what top

[01:09:30] **Speaker**: okay so you see the point of symmetry is

[01:09:34] **Speaker**: the nine and down to the middle this is
the axis yeah 
[01:09:39] **Speaker**: the axis

[01:09:41] **Speaker**: there is an invisible line

[01:09:44] **Speaker**: axis

[01:09:46] **Speaker**: it's an invisible spindle yeah

[01:09:49] **Speaker**: okay

[01:09:51] **Speaker**: because you're still moving off of

[01:09:56] **Speaker**: that's incredible

[01:09:58] **Speaker**: that's

[01:10:00] **Speaker**: I I'm seeing something I'm not sure I

[01:10:02] **Speaker**: understand but it's like you've got

[01:10:04] **Speaker**: you've got the whole way that things are

[01:10:07] **Speaker**: unfolded

[01:10:08] **Speaker**: yeah

[01:10:10] **Speaker**: nine times three to twenty seven

[01:10:16] **Speaker**: it is

[01:10:18] **Speaker**: it is perfect

[01:10:22] **Speaker**: perfect diagram
all right Judy 
[01:10:40] **Speaker**: now you can say that

[01:10:42] **Speaker**: how many parts

[01:10:43] **Speaker**: are there in the union yet

[01:10:47] **Speaker**: one part he's trying to play safe

[01:10:54] **Speaker**: okay and how did it become one then I'll

[01:10:58] **Speaker**: take that answer we'll call on that

[01:10:59] **Speaker**: theme I'll learn something with all of

[01:11:01] **Speaker**: us okay so we have this perimeter it's

[01:11:04] **Speaker**: called the world boundary condition

[01:11:06] **Speaker**: is that what you mean by one it's a

[01:11:09] **Speaker**: whole it's a units in other words one is

[01:11:10] **Speaker**: Unity it's in either one

[01:11:18] **Speaker**: or the way in the nature of it but you

[01:11:20] **Speaker**: gotta be you gotta be real detail

[01:11:23] **Speaker**: oriented you gotta tear it into its

[01:11:25] **Speaker**: rudiments right you have to break it

[01:11:28] **Speaker**: into its parameters

[01:11:30] **Speaker**: so I I agree with you it is the evidence

[01:11:32] **Speaker**: law of the alpha omega the beginning and

[01:11:34] **Speaker**: end okay which is right there
okay 
[01:11:41] **Speaker**: but the Mobius strip is the one two four

[01:11:46] **Speaker**: eight seven five right here
okay um I I could have been doing a 
[01:11:51] **Speaker**: demonstration for everybody show

[01:11:52] **Speaker**: everyone what Mobius is but

[01:11:54] **Speaker**: we're not going to try it

[01:11:59] **Speaker**: you know I was when I read the dial

[01:12:02] **Speaker**: physics Judy

[01:12:05] **Speaker**: this is not the Mobius strip

[01:12:07] **Speaker**: three and six is not the movie The Strip

[01:12:16] **Speaker**: is not the Mobius church I was playing

[01:12:20] **Speaker**: with

[01:12:21] **Speaker**: playing with you oh it is a three-part

[01:12:24] **Speaker**: thing it is a three-part thing oh yeah

[01:12:31] **Speaker**: it is the the energy the Synergy is the

[01:12:34] **Speaker**: energy which is the S curve the S curve

[01:12:37] **Speaker**: is the number nine it is your third part

[01:12:42] **Speaker**: yeah it's the world boundary condition

[01:12:44] **Speaker**: and what it does is that when you learn

[01:12:47] **Speaker**: about these Road boundary conditions and

[01:12:49] **Speaker**: you can have control over

[01:12:50] **Speaker**: superconductivity you have a

[01:12:52] **Speaker**: controllable flight to the universe

[01:12:54] **Speaker**: everything it it's and this is what

[01:12:57] **Speaker**: we're learning about right now so what

[01:13:00] **Speaker**: is happening is is that the three parts

[01:13:02] **Speaker**: of the yin and yang you only see the yin

[01:13:04] **Speaker**: and yang oscillating back and forth

[01:13:06] **Speaker**: but the yin and yang does not connect

[01:13:09] **Speaker**: the pyramid on the base

[01:13:11] **Speaker**: you have

[01:13:13] **Speaker**: the nine in the center

[01:13:17] **Speaker**: okay which is the control
okay 
[01:13:23] **Speaker**: um

[01:13:24] **Speaker**: family member groups is where we were

[01:13:27] **Speaker**: yesterday

[01:13:28] **Speaker**: okay

[01:13:31] **Speaker**: so
just because 
[01:13:37] **Speaker**: we better do we better

[01:13:39] **Speaker**: consolidate everything we've done and be

[01:13:42] **Speaker**: thorough here's a multiplication table
one through nine 
[01:13:45] **Speaker**: Judy you're going to get to be the
assistant 
[01:13:57] **Speaker**: That's The Wheel of Fortune

[01:14:12] **Speaker**: okay okay

[01:14:14] **Speaker**: so what we're gonna do

[01:14:16] **Speaker**: is we know one and eight are perfect

[01:14:18] **Speaker**: mirrors remember the mirror of the

[01:14:20] **Speaker**: number of the multiplication series

[01:14:21] **Speaker**: which is beginning with one the last

[01:14:24] **Speaker**: number before nine is going to be what

[01:14:26] **Speaker**: its mirror is it's polar so we're going

[01:14:28] **Speaker**: to take eight

[01:14:30] **Speaker**: no not eight we're going to take one but
we're going to know that 8 is going to 
[01:14:33] **Speaker**: be the mirror so let's just flip them

[01:14:34] **Speaker**: all just flip them all right over eight

[01:14:36] **Speaker**: seven six five four three

[01:14:42] **Speaker**: two one nine so what we have is we have

[01:14:46] **Speaker**: the opposite of ones is multiplications
of eight 
[01:14:50] **Speaker**: yet the family number groups are always

[01:14:52] **Speaker**: separated by thirds one two three is the

[01:14:54] **Speaker**: next blue one one two three is the next

[01:14:57] **Speaker**: movement after that one they're always

[01:14:58] **Speaker**: separated by thirds this is a quality of

[01:15:00] **Speaker**: numbers a fundamental physical property

[01:15:03] **Speaker**: characteristic of numbers and the color
is 
[01:15:12] **Speaker**: exactly right Charlie but it's a duality

[01:15:14] **Speaker**: compliment Charlie because there's two

[01:15:16] **Speaker**: separate Dimensions the yellow is a

[01:15:18] **Speaker**: different dimension but the red and blue

[01:15:20] **Speaker**: are the same dimensions yellow right

[01:15:23] **Speaker**: doesn't it yeah

[01:15:24] **Speaker**: it did say y'all yeah

[01:15:27] **Speaker**: but the eight was where the bread

[01:15:29] **Speaker**: they're all three three always three

[01:15:32] **Speaker**: three right

[01:15:35] **Speaker**: okay so now let's let's do multiples of
two would you put a two or the eight is 
[01:15:40] **Speaker**: and then put a four so you're just gonna
go two four six eight one three five 
[01:15:43] **Speaker**: seven nine

[01:15:44] **Speaker**: yeah Charlie is a couple of leagues

[01:15:46] **Speaker**: ahead of us right now because what he's

[01:15:48] **Speaker**: modeling is dimension why are you

[01:15:50] **Speaker**: putting the two there because we I just

[01:15:52] **Speaker**: went instead of multiples of one I want
to do multiples of two I just want to do 
[01:15:55] **Speaker**: you're starting over again starting over
again 
[01:16:00] **Speaker**: and then you're gonna put four next
right here 
[01:16:09] **Speaker**: Charlie will call it for you go ahead

[01:16:10] **Speaker**: Charlie toys

[01:16:12] **Speaker**: Nick yeah Judy you can beat Charlie's
assistant 
[01:16:27] **Speaker**: yeah I'd love to see someone else do my

[01:16:29] **Speaker**: same mistake that I always do because

[01:16:30] **Speaker**: I'm so deep into it well

[01:16:37] **Speaker**: he's free

[01:16:39] **Speaker**: okay family number groups are still the

[01:16:42] **Speaker**: same now remember I said there's no

[01:16:44] **Speaker**: redundancy

[01:16:46] **Speaker**: and there's never nothing's omitted but

[01:16:49] **Speaker**: you're but your building blocks are

[01:16:51] **Speaker**: those three family number groups you
can't invent in them 
[01:16:57] **Speaker**: so yeah so we're starting with yeah a

[01:17:00] **Speaker**: number cannot be created or destroyed

[01:17:02] **Speaker**: destroyed just as we used to say in

[01:17:03] **Speaker**: Einstein's law that the energy what's

[01:17:06] **Speaker**: the same matter

[01:17:09] **Speaker**: Matter's not can you can neither be

[01:17:12] **Speaker**: created or destroyed so it turns out the

[01:17:14] **Speaker**: same thing for numbers too

[01:17:16] **Speaker**: there's no new numbers creatable

[01:17:19] **Speaker**: it's really heavy duty because
um 
[01:17:27] **Speaker**: that's a quick that is a real

[01:17:30] **Speaker**: information compression condensation but
you're absolutely right 
[01:17:38] **Speaker**: I never saw that movie too

[01:17:44] **Speaker**: Underground

[01:17:46] **Speaker**: oh that was wasn't that um

[01:17:49] **Speaker**: that was an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie

[01:17:51] **Speaker**: you know it was it was Mel Gibson

[01:17:56] **Speaker**: comparative religion

[01:18:01] **Speaker**: I never saw that movie too

[01:18:09] **Speaker**: no that was wasn't that uh

[01:18:12] **Speaker**: that was an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
healthy 
[01:18:28] **Speaker**: to try the power of things

[01:18:33] **Speaker**: she could say Triune she could say

[01:18:35] **Speaker**: trinity she could say

[01:18:37] **Speaker**: yeah

[01:18:38] **Speaker**: well okay

[01:18:41] **Speaker**: but what we're looking at is a polar

[01:18:43] **Speaker**: opposite a polar complement always

[01:18:45] **Speaker**: equals nine see how one make nine seven

[01:18:47] **Speaker**: two make nine okay this is just the

[01:18:49] **Speaker**: polar property we're learning okay

[01:18:53] **Speaker**: um that's I now learns that they're

[01:18:55] **Speaker**: separated by three so let's go again now

[01:18:57] **Speaker**: we know that the polar opposite of two

[01:18:59] **Speaker**: is seven so let because seven is the

[01:19:01] **Speaker**: last number before nine so let's turn
the cards over 
[01:19:20] **Speaker**: they're pink

[01:19:22] **Speaker**: I did make them a different color oh
they probably should have oh it's because I want to distinguish between 
[01:19:27] **Speaker**: three and six

[01:19:29] **Speaker**: that there's a positive and negative

[01:19:31] **Speaker**: three and six it gets pretty more

[01:19:33] **Speaker**: confusing I better not try and say it

[01:19:35] **Speaker**: verbally so is that correct that you did

[01:19:37] **Speaker**: change that for you I it's correct that

[01:19:39] **Speaker**: there's a negative positive God knows I

[01:19:41] **Speaker**: can't even so then I'll be six now six

[01:19:43] **Speaker**: six six I just know how it works I can't

[01:19:44] **Speaker**: say I can't say on those cards house
correct I only know it in the 
[01:19:48] **Speaker**: complicated I get it's very hard for me

[01:19:50] **Speaker**: to do it in a simple fashion the

[01:19:51] **Speaker**: complicated what you're about to go to I

[01:19:54] **Speaker**: can tell you what's correct the easy

[01:19:55] **Speaker**: step is hard for me because it's too

[01:19:58] **Speaker**: easy and the universe is more complex

[01:20:04] **Speaker**: I wouldn't call it a compliment

[01:20:08] **Speaker**: um but it's a buddy

[01:20:22] **Speaker**: well what's on the other side

[01:20:25] **Speaker**: okay so that's better

[01:20:27] **Speaker**: no it's always essentially what it is is

[01:20:30] **Speaker**: I'm not sure what you mean everything is

[01:20:32] **Speaker**: still in thirds but what happens is the

[01:20:34] **Speaker**: six occurs automatically

[01:20:43] **Speaker**: 12 15 and 6 and then one at eight is

[01:20:46] **Speaker**: nine is a kid's at six and six nine

[01:20:48] **Speaker**: that's six oh so we can take triplets

[01:20:51] **Speaker**: and they add like the last time

[01:20:52] **Speaker**: everything was always three three you

[01:20:56] **Speaker**: flipped it out now there's always going

[01:20:58] **Speaker**: to be a three is six and a nine and

[01:21:00] **Speaker**: eight which ones she's saying that that

[01:21:03] **Speaker**: triplet right there adds up to six oh oh

[01:21:07] **Speaker**: sure she's working

[01:21:10] **Speaker**: three every time it's not even in the

[01:21:13] **Speaker**: curriculum she's working in things that

[01:21:15] **Speaker**: are apparent that have Universal truths

[01:21:17] **Speaker**: and axioms and she's working there's

[01:21:19] **Speaker**: she's now she's working on on aspects

[01:21:23] **Speaker**: and facets of this stuff that I've never

[01:21:25] **Speaker**: even gotten to

[01:21:27] **Speaker**: well I teach little kids and little kids

[01:21:29] **Speaker**: think that way they even see that you

[01:21:32] **Speaker**: guys didn't see any generations

[01:21:35] **Speaker**: and it all has me

[01:21:37] **Speaker**: and I haven't even gotten to that and it

[01:21:39] **Speaker**: helps explain this it helps that they

[01:21:41] **Speaker**: don't have other things you know

[01:21:42] **Speaker**: cluttering and obscuring that's why we

[01:21:45] **Speaker**: need you to be a new example for kitchen

[01:21:48] **Speaker**: map Next Generation because the way to

[01:21:51] **Speaker**: learn math the way you learn like the

[01:21:53] **Speaker**: structure of reality in a lot of ways I

[01:21:55] **Speaker**: mean just like the calendar systems that

[01:21:57] **Speaker**: we have calendar being off affects every

[01:22:00] **Speaker**: other part of our civilization so just

[01:22:02] **Speaker**: like ours

[01:22:03] **Speaker**: okay so

[01:22:05] **Speaker**: um we saw family number groups

[01:22:08] **Speaker**: um

[01:22:09] **Speaker**: are always the same

[01:22:12] **Speaker**: in the different groups let's see

[01:22:15] **Speaker**: I don't know which word to go to next

[01:22:18] **Speaker**: um we covered family member groups the

[01:22:20] **Speaker**: fan cut we solve the multiplication that

[01:22:23] **Speaker**: numbers actually did have a mirroring in

[01:22:25] **Speaker**: the geometry

[01:22:27] **Speaker**: um we were looking at the boundary
condition she said one on the yin and 
[01:22:31] **Speaker**: yang

[01:22:31] **Speaker**: so let's see

[01:22:34] **Speaker**: what we can do with

[01:22:38] **Speaker**: um

[01:22:39] **Speaker**: with what we've learned so far

[01:22:42] **Speaker**: so we know the quality of every number

[01:22:45] **Speaker**: so we know the quality of this number is

[01:22:47] **Speaker**: the mirror of that number quality we

[01:22:48] **Speaker**: know this quality is a mean of that so

[01:22:50] **Speaker**: we got one quality two quality three

[01:22:52] **Speaker**: qualities four qualities five qualities

[01:22:55] **Speaker**: six qualities right well by the Pam by

[01:23:00] **Speaker**: the fact of that they're different from

[01:23:02] **Speaker**: one another like this number there's no

[01:23:04] **Speaker**: other number that goes up one two three

[01:23:05] **Speaker**: four it's Unique multiples of one

[01:23:10] **Speaker**: that's the clustering of a group a

[01:23:12] **Speaker**: family group yeah well that whole thing

[01:23:14] **Speaker**: is a clustering of the family group

[01:23:16] **Speaker**: right it gives a unique quality right

[01:23:18] **Speaker**: exactly right and then that has a

[01:23:20] **Speaker**: different uh proof to it that's exactly

[01:23:22] **Speaker**: right that's why it is the number two

[01:23:24] **Speaker**: right exactly why it has that number

[01:23:27] **Speaker**: that's why essentially the basis for a

[01:23:29] **Speaker**: dimensionality

[01:23:30] **Speaker**: of sources like yeah yeah

[01:23:33] **Speaker**: I like that when Charlie clicks on

[01:23:36] **Speaker**: something it's because he's he's

[01:23:37] **Speaker**: dimensionalized it I mean it's like

[01:23:42] **Speaker**: it's really good so we too has a quality

[01:23:45] **Speaker**: and four has a quality and eight has a
quality it's really a trip that when 
[01:23:50] **Speaker**: you're at the lowest bottom you go to

[01:23:51] **Speaker**: the top is where you go next because

[01:23:53] **Speaker**: this is a coil this our decimal system

[01:23:56] **Speaker**: is equal

[01:23:57] **Speaker**: and this is the field and this is the

[01:24:00] **Speaker**: secret of electromagnetism

[01:24:02] **Speaker**: because that's why I'm getting more

[01:24:04] **Speaker**: energy

[01:24:06] **Speaker**: and this is going to replace our Auto

[01:24:08] **Speaker**: petroleum products every this is the
legend for it 
[01:24:14] **Speaker**: so set is equality and five's equality

[01:24:17] **Speaker**: okay three and six the quality was that
they always oscillate back and forth of course the multiples would be three six 
[01:24:23] **Speaker**: nine three six nine or six three nine

[01:24:24] **Speaker**: six three nine it says it right here in

[01:24:28] **Speaker**: multiples and we have the nine nine

[01:24:31] **Speaker**: never changes it's a quality because

[01:24:32] **Speaker**: zero times anything is always nothing

[01:24:34] **Speaker**: it's the absolute quality and Nine's

[01:24:36] **Speaker**: complete quality it's whole and there it

[01:24:39] **Speaker**: is so it's always nine and what's

[01:24:41] **Speaker**: multiple two nines is 18

[01:24:43] **Speaker**: 27 36 45

[01:24:47] **Speaker**: 54 63 7281 always equals itself nine

[01:24:52] **Speaker**: it's the never changing number nine

[01:24:56] **Speaker**: perfect complete so it's compressible so
that's why it'll work 
[01:25:05] **Speaker**: I'm gonna just let your big numbers that
are non-compressible 
[01:25:14] **Speaker**: there is no such thing as a

[01:25:16] **Speaker**: non-repeeding endless decimal that's why

[01:25:19] **Speaker**: I saw Pi which I'm not going to try and

[01:25:21] **Speaker**: touch but I found the answer to Pi I

[01:25:23] **Speaker**: know what it is and it's a whole number

[01:25:25] **Speaker**: but we're not going to touch that at

[01:25:27] **Speaker**: this moment

[01:25:28] **Speaker**: okay

[01:25:30] **Speaker**: you can keep on thinking I just want to

[01:25:32] **Speaker**: say a few more cute things about nine

[01:25:34] **Speaker**: okay let's first look at a six a six is

[01:25:40] **Speaker**: a hexagon six-sided

[01:25:43] **Speaker**: a triangle

[01:25:45] **Speaker**: is the three but as we know in reality

[01:25:49] **Speaker**: the triangle doesn't connect except that

[01:25:50] **Speaker**: the vertex the point

[01:25:52] **Speaker**: and the nine this is very important and

[01:25:54] **Speaker**: it's not by accident is

[01:25:57] **Speaker**: a perfect diamond see how this makes a

[01:26:00] **Speaker**: diamond should have been a little bit

[01:26:02] **Speaker**: better a little bit more perfect but it

[01:26:04] **Speaker**: is the perfect diamond
so we'll see 
[01:26:17] **Speaker**: when you um you use like connected with

[01:26:20] **Speaker**: other people

[01:26:21] **Speaker**: yeah the free energy design is the

[01:26:24] **Speaker**: camera on I guess everybody does give

[01:26:25] **Speaker**: their permission I guess this is a

[01:26:27] **Speaker**: release you give your permission to be

[01:26:29] **Speaker**: this is a verbal written in a video and

[01:26:34] **Speaker**: what's video map written and uh

[01:26:36] **Speaker**: an acetate that you don't mind having

[01:26:39] **Speaker**: yourself raise your hands or something

[01:26:41] **Speaker**: you're being duplicated and disseminated

[01:26:46] **Speaker**: and circulated

[01:26:47] **Speaker**: to help educate and teach people on this

[01:26:50] **Speaker**: topic so thank you very much for

[01:26:52] **Speaker**: allowing

[01:26:55] **Speaker**: educating people and sharing your

[01:26:57] **Speaker**: insights with the world
um 
[01:27:02] **Speaker**: okay
um 
[01:27:06] **Speaker**: Charlie has a question but before

[01:27:08] **Speaker**: Charlie does it
I want to finish this one point all over 
[01:27:12] **Speaker**: again
okay 
[01:27:16] **Speaker**: the number nine never changes there's

[01:27:19] **Speaker**: not another number that doesn't change

[01:27:22] **Speaker**: okay only number nine can do that zero

[01:27:25] **Speaker**: is nothing zero times anything something

[01:27:27] **Speaker**: and by the way zero is not a member of a

[01:27:29] **Speaker**: multiplication series that's why after

[01:27:30] **Speaker**: nine is not a zero the zeros The Vortex

[01:27:34] **Speaker**: and this is making a vortex
okay um 
[01:27:39] **Speaker**: I'll come to that Vortex after I answer

[01:27:41] **Speaker**: Charlie's question so multiples of two

[01:27:43] **Speaker**: there's not another thing that doesn't

[01:27:45] **Speaker**: like it you can't and if you had a

[01:27:48] **Speaker**: multiple if you had a base 12 you would

[01:27:50] **Speaker**: still be using

[01:27:52] **Speaker**: um the one and the two and three again

[01:27:53] **Speaker**: because it's after nine and so you would

[01:27:56] **Speaker**: be duplicating at least as a fathom as a

[01:27:58] **Speaker**: mirror to eight seven and six in other

[01:28:01] **Speaker**: words you would be actually doing a

[01:28:05] **Speaker**: mirror Imaging like including

[01:28:07] **Speaker**: photography of

[01:28:11] **Speaker**: um the leaves right there okay you know

[01:28:14] **Speaker**: familiar photography you have an

[01:28:16] **Speaker**: appendage cut off fingers put on the

[01:28:19] **Speaker**: photographic of motion in your hand you

[01:28:21] **Speaker**: still see that finger it's a phantom of

[01:28:22] **Speaker**: ghosting image do you remember that
yes 
[01:28:28] **Speaker**: oh yeah you didn't know that I didn't

[01:28:30] **Speaker**: know it was still there it's a trip it

[01:28:33] **Speaker**: doesn't work

[01:28:35] **Speaker**: um it's so well known now
um 
[01:28:40] **Speaker**: what happened is your bioelectric field

[01:28:43] **Speaker**: doesn't know it was cut off

[01:28:47] **Speaker**: okay so your biological field all

[01:28:50] **Speaker**: everything else is still projecting the

[01:28:52] **Speaker**: energy out and around it and you can

[01:28:54] **Speaker**: have a person missing a whole finger put

[01:28:56] **Speaker**: his hand in photographic emotion and

[01:28:58] **Speaker**: he's got all his fingers Charlie you've

[01:29:01] **Speaker**: seen that well not only that the people

[01:29:03] **Speaker**: still feel yeah

[01:29:05] **Speaker**: they're still there even when they've

[01:29:08] **Speaker**: been amputated

[01:29:10] **Speaker**: still there so the

[01:29:12] **Speaker**: still that's subjective by them in this

[01:29:14] **Speaker**: case I'm saying it's film emotion so we

[01:29:17] **Speaker**: can actually see that you and you've
seen it 
[01:29:21] **Speaker**: I've seen it

[01:29:22] **Speaker**: photographs exactly

[01:29:25] **Speaker**: there's someone here that does that it

[01:29:27] **Speaker**: was all done in Russia
yeah 
[01:29:33] **Speaker**: but she did that on me actually

[01:29:36] **Speaker**: say a few days on your fingers yeah yeah

[01:29:39] **Speaker**: but he's still he's able to read those
so yeah 
[01:29:46] **Speaker**: and then she does color one she doesn't

[01:29:48] **Speaker**: black and white one and then she does

[01:29:50] **Speaker**: the color one they're pretty pretty neat

[01:29:52] **Speaker**: so what about increasing the biological

[01:29:55] **Speaker**: frequency where the missing finger is

[01:29:56] **Speaker**: being able to make a finger grow back is
that okay 
[01:30:02] **Speaker**: well then you can they can do that at

[01:30:04] **Speaker**: certain stages of you know children if a

[01:30:07] **Speaker**: child loses because of her finger you
know from like about the first kids in 
[01:30:11] **Speaker**: honored
and we'll go back 
[01:30:16] **Speaker**: to have it Forward right there showing

[01:30:18] **Speaker**: the fingers so you're right

[01:30:22] **Speaker**: um

[01:30:24] **Speaker**: so numbers themselves

[01:30:27] **Speaker**: by the very existence of a one it

[01:30:30] **Speaker**: creates an a phantom of the eight

[01:30:35] **Speaker**: so there is not endless as to the points

[01:30:38] **Speaker**: we were reading such as that how many

[01:30:41] **Speaker**: base systems are there

[01:30:44] **Speaker**: okay

[01:30:46] **Speaker**: we say it says somewhere

[01:30:51] **Speaker**: it says how many counting based systems

[01:30:54] **Speaker**: are there there's only one

[01:30:57] **Speaker**: pretty hard for medicine to swallow

[01:31:00] **Speaker**: there's only one base counting system
okay 
[01:31:08] **Speaker**: remind me I want to go to polarity and I

[01:31:11] **Speaker**: want to go through the vortex two things

[01:31:12] **Speaker**: please

[01:31:14] **Speaker**: okay Charlie

[01:31:17] **Speaker**: um I'm unclear as to how you're defining

[01:31:19] **Speaker**: each of those numbers on

[01:31:23] **Speaker**: Corners there it represents a a group a

[01:31:26] **Speaker**: family of numbers right like one that

[01:31:29] **Speaker**: the family member group the first one of

[01:31:31] **Speaker**: 147 represents totally different planes

[01:31:34] **Speaker**: of spatial orientation or points this

[01:31:37] **Speaker**: one's at the top and never have two

[01:31:38] **Speaker**: family member groups occupying both tops

[01:31:41] **Speaker**: only one there's one's at the bottom and

[01:31:46] **Speaker**: the other ones is the middle and they

[01:31:47] **Speaker**: are as far triangulated away that's a

[01:31:50] **Speaker**: number group right here

[01:31:52] **Speaker**: what about one itself is that a number

[01:31:54] **Speaker**: Group by itself no it can't okay so 147

[01:31:57] **Speaker**: is the group you're referring and that

[01:31:59] **Speaker**: thing's less than groups of threes

[01:32:01] **Speaker**: okay so and how is that made into uh

[01:32:09] **Speaker**: how it's really made to the number group
is that these emanations are shooting and this is what you're asking but this 
[01:32:14] **Speaker**: is the correct answer there's three

[01:32:15] **Speaker**: emanations shooting out at the same time

[01:32:17] **Speaker**: and if they're shooting out

[01:32:19] **Speaker**: dimensionally Charlie one's going right

[01:32:21] **Speaker**: here one's going right here and one's

[01:32:23] **Speaker**: right here and as these three are

[01:32:24] **Speaker**: shooting out three points ahead of them

[01:32:27] **Speaker**: okay is the last one that went out

[01:32:29] **Speaker**: before them so there's space space next

[01:32:31] **Speaker**: emanation so they don't just shoot out

[01:32:34] **Speaker**: and then there's another one then

[01:32:35] **Speaker**: another one you have three each time say

[01:32:37] **Speaker**: it again everything's controlled by

[01:32:39] **Speaker**: three okay you add three to one to get

[01:32:41] **Speaker**: four and then you add three more to get

[01:32:43] **Speaker**: seven right and then you add three more

[01:32:45] **Speaker**: and you get one again so those Cycles

[01:32:47] **Speaker**: those are grouping themselves right with

[01:32:50] **Speaker**: with differences of three I admire you

[01:32:52] **Speaker**: Charlie for learning this because your

[01:32:54] **Speaker**: math is you've learned so much the fact

[01:32:56] **Speaker**: you can deal with such easy basic things

[01:32:57] **Speaker**: really is a big accomplishment because

[01:33:00] **Speaker**: it's much harder for you than it is for
normal people 
[01:33:06] **Speaker**: by themselves they're just parts of them

[01:33:09] **Speaker**: that's right but the blues and the pinks

[01:33:14] **Speaker**: are closed closed groupings exactly yeah

[01:33:18] **Speaker**: definitely close yeah Creations a closed

[01:33:22] **Speaker**: creation that's why it's called abounded

[01:33:24] **Speaker**: Infinity it's an Infinity of duration

[01:33:27] **Speaker**: not Direction the duration is the spin

[01:33:30] **Speaker**: Continuum it's never it's Infinity of

[01:33:33] **Speaker**: motions but it is not infinitely going

[01:33:36] **Speaker**: out into space because it's warping and

[01:33:39] **Speaker**: being curved by the intersections of the

[01:33:41] **Speaker**: examinations it causes it to warp it's

[01:33:44] **Speaker**: like a little picker and it causes it to

[01:33:47] **Speaker**: spin and as they spin ever hit a leaf on

[01:33:50] **Speaker**: the lawn picks up in the air and comes
closer to you than where it began from 
[01:33:53] **Speaker**: instead of going away where you wanted

[01:33:54] **Speaker**: it to okay that's what these things are

[01:33:56] **Speaker**: doing they're being warped

[01:33:58] **Speaker**: okay and this is relativity here again

[01:34:01] **Speaker**: this is Einstein c squared and it has an

[01:34:03] **Speaker**: axis it's a self-conclusive relativity

[01:34:06] **Speaker**: it's so extremely relative that it's

[01:34:08] **Speaker**: relative to its convergence point which

[01:34:10] **Speaker**: is right here everything has an axis and

[01:34:13] **Speaker**: this is a fixed constant this is an

[01:34:15] **Speaker**: absolute the number nine represents

[01:34:18] **Speaker**: truth

[01:34:19] **Speaker**: Perfection consciousness what's called a

[01:34:23] **Speaker**: fixed constant there's two schools of

[01:34:25] **Speaker**: thoughts in the world there's one that

[01:34:27] **Speaker**: there are not fixed constants and the
other ones is that there are fixed 
[01:34:30] **Speaker**: constants mine is is that there are

[01:34:31] **Speaker**: fixed constants these are called axioms

[01:34:33] **Speaker**: theorems it's called Divine virtues

[01:34:36] **Speaker**: spiritual principles they can be applied

[01:34:38] **Speaker**: just as fast you can go from spiritual

[01:34:40] **Speaker**: to physics and physics back to spiritual

[01:34:43] **Speaker**: it can be spiritual can be love Faith

[01:34:47] **Speaker**: trust in physics it can be

[01:34:51] **Speaker**: um

[01:34:52] **Speaker**: the axis the number nine why a gyroscope

[01:34:56] **Speaker**: always stands up on its own and it spins

[01:34:59] **Speaker**: so by saying there's no fixed constants

[01:35:01] **Speaker**: basically sounds like

[01:35:04] **Speaker**: atheism or theism exactly there's

[01:35:07] **Speaker**: constantly entropy there's no order in

[01:35:08] **Speaker**: the universe versus you know stages

[01:35:10] **Speaker**: everything has a Divine on it exactly

[01:35:12] **Speaker**: right I'm glad you said it that was a

[01:35:14] **Speaker**: good point

[01:35:16] **Speaker**: Charlie you didn't ask your question

[01:35:17] **Speaker**: though yeah they did I'm clear as to

[01:35:20] **Speaker**: what you're talking about now and I'm

[01:35:22] **Speaker**: just doing some other things okay

[01:35:28] **Speaker**: hilarity
okay 
[01:35:33] **Speaker**: um the number one if it's positive the

[01:35:36] **Speaker**: number two is going to be negative

[01:35:37] **Speaker**: number four is going to be positive the

[01:35:40] **Speaker**: number 8 is going to be negative the

[01:35:42] **Speaker**: number seven is going to be positive the

[01:35:45] **Speaker**: number 5

[01:35:47] **Speaker**: is going to be negative excuse me and

[01:35:50] **Speaker**: number one is positive so it's going

[01:35:51] **Speaker**: back and forth back and forth positive

[01:35:54] **Speaker**: negative there's your binary flip flop

[01:35:56] **Speaker**: positive negative positive negative okay

[01:36:01] **Speaker**: um

[01:36:03] **Speaker**: um okay Larry because there's only six

[01:36:06] **Speaker**: numbers in our physical world of

[01:36:08] **Speaker**: creation one two four eight seven five

[01:36:10] **Speaker**: okay which is a fact okay in other words

[01:36:14] **Speaker**: in the third with matter there's only

[01:36:16] **Speaker**: six numbers to work with

[01:36:19] **Speaker**: okay

[01:36:20] **Speaker**: you don't have to worry about there

[01:36:22] **Speaker**: being an odd number like that when they
try and do a positive negative and positive negative when you get to nine you're the positive and then you go back 
[01:36:28] **Speaker**: to one it's negative but you start with

[01:36:29] **Speaker**: a positive it doesn't work because there

[01:36:32] **Speaker**: is not an odd system the physical world

[01:36:34] **Speaker**: of mass always has symmetry always has

[01:36:35] **Speaker**: parity because it's an even amount six

[01:36:38] **Speaker**: is an even amount of number things are

[01:36:40] **Speaker**: always done in pairs

[01:36:43] **Speaker**: okay

[01:36:44] **Speaker**: so this

[01:36:46] **Speaker**: but it's complicated

[01:36:48] **Speaker**: this is where Quantum comes in

[01:36:50] **Speaker**: first of all

[01:36:52] **Speaker**: the center of the circle

[01:36:55] **Speaker**: and I'm just teaching you guys how to be

[01:36:56] **Speaker**: prepared to make this into the next

[01:36:58] **Speaker**: chart and there's another chart behind

[01:37:00] **Speaker**: here and there's many charts over here

[01:37:04] **Speaker**: okay so this is called The Legend this

[01:37:06] **Speaker**: is God's schematic it's the blueprint

[01:37:07] **Speaker**: once you learn the math from this then

[01:37:09] **Speaker**: you start doing calculating and

[01:37:11] **Speaker**: functions and essentially you start

[01:37:13] **Speaker**: calculating

[01:37:16] **Speaker**: this stuff I'll let you see where you're

[01:37:18] **Speaker**: going to
okay 
[01:37:23] **Speaker**: so you start going into more advanced

[01:37:25] **Speaker**: physics it's called cosmology of the

[01:37:28] **Speaker**: universe

[01:37:29] **Speaker**: okay
so 
[01:37:34] **Speaker**: so if you have

[01:37:36] **Speaker**: a circle this is the center but what

[01:37:38] **Speaker**: look at this the center's way off down

[01:37:40] **Speaker**: here remember this is explaining things

[01:37:43] **Speaker**: Okay the reason it's off is because

[01:37:46] **Speaker**: there's more to it

[01:37:48] **Speaker**: because if we had a positive one we know

[01:37:50] **Speaker**: we must must also have a negative one

[01:37:53] **Speaker**: okay so there's another one

[01:37:55] **Speaker**: Notch seen here that's also negative

[01:37:58] **Speaker**: there's another two that's also positive

[01:37:59] **Speaker**: that's totally reverse of all this so

[01:38:02] **Speaker**: instead of nine I now need 18 to

[01:38:04] **Speaker**: represent the system does everyone

[01:38:06] **Speaker**: follow me

[01:38:07] **Speaker**: through I if I had I have six one two

[01:38:11] **Speaker**: forty seven fives I need another six

[01:38:12] **Speaker**: which is 12 to represent one two four

[01:38:15] **Speaker**: eight seven five I'm just saying this I

[01:38:17] **Speaker**: think it'll be lost but and that gives

[01:38:19] **Speaker**: me 12 and there's nothing less than

[01:38:21] **Speaker**: packets of nine so if I had one nine now

[01:38:24] **Speaker**: I got two nines okay because and there's

[01:38:27] **Speaker**: uh six and six is twelve okay where are

[01:38:30] **Speaker**: my two other where's my other group of

[01:38:32] **Speaker**: six

[01:38:34] **Speaker**: um to make 18. okay it happens to be

[01:38:38] **Speaker**: this 396.

[01:38:40] **Speaker**: I've said that in the physical world

[01:38:42] **Speaker**: there's this Duality okay in the higher

[01:38:46] **Speaker**: world

[01:38:47] **Speaker**: there's also a duality but The Duality

[01:38:50] **Speaker**: is to try and make this third

[01:38:53] **Speaker**: dimensional reality a mirror or a

[01:38:56] **Speaker**: reflection of this greater world yet all

[01:38:58] **Speaker**: the time while we're trying to be a

[01:38:59] **Speaker**: hologram of this greater World we're at

[01:39:01] **Speaker**: the same time created by it so we are

[01:39:04] **Speaker**: essentially tied to it we are bounded to

[01:39:09] **Speaker**: binded with it and we have we are

[01:39:11] **Speaker**: actually signs or proofs of its

[01:39:13] **Speaker**: existence and what happens is is that

[01:39:16] **Speaker**: the higher linear emanation of nine

[01:39:18] **Speaker**: becomes the third invisible force that

[01:39:22] **Speaker**: does not allow anything else

[01:39:25] **Speaker**: to be greater than it thus we can mirror

[01:39:28] **Speaker**: God but we'll never be greater than God

[01:39:30] **Speaker**: so what happens when 9 is a positive

[01:39:33] **Speaker**: three and six are both negative

[01:39:37] **Speaker**: okay

[01:39:39] **Speaker**: okay

[01:39:41] **Speaker**: it is the control three and six are the
result 
[01:39:47] **Speaker**: now in reality

[01:39:49] **Speaker**: just like I have two hands here but it

[01:39:52] **Speaker**: looks like one I really have six here I

[01:39:56] **Speaker**: don't really have three of the 396 I

[01:39:58] **Speaker**: really have six

[01:40:00] **Speaker**: okay and I'll show you how it works

[01:40:03] **Speaker**: we started with the negative three

[01:40:05] **Speaker**: here's our binary flip flop back and

[01:40:07] **Speaker**: forth

[01:40:08] **Speaker**: we go negative positive negative our

[01:40:13] **Speaker**: next positive is not going to be nine we

[01:40:15] **Speaker**: already got a positive nine our next

[01:40:17] **Speaker**: positive is going to be the invisible 6

[01:40:20] **Speaker**: that you can't see behind it that it's

[01:40:22] **Speaker**: laid over and that's going to be your

[01:40:25] **Speaker**: positive okay there's an invisible 9

[01:40:28] **Speaker**: under there that's going to be your

[01:40:30] **Speaker**: negative okay and there's an invisible 3

[01:40:34] **Speaker**: over here and that's going to be a

[01:40:36] **Speaker**: positive whenever you end on a number

[01:40:39] **Speaker**: it's an you always there's a second one

[01:40:42] **Speaker**: hidden by it you then give it the
reverse polarity and go in the opposite 
[01:40:46] **Speaker**: direction

[01:40:47] **Speaker**: it's one of the principles of this map

[01:40:50] **Speaker**: everyone follows me

[01:40:54] **Speaker**: okay so now you know there must be

[01:40:56] **Speaker**: duplicate there always must be a

[01:40:58] **Speaker**: positive and negative to everything we

[01:41:00] **Speaker**: have that

[01:41:01] **Speaker**: it must and that

[01:41:04] **Speaker**: it's not based on the fact of the

[01:41:06] **Speaker**: duality of the positive and negative but

[01:41:08] **Speaker**: it's based on a trinary where you're

[01:41:10] **Speaker**: going to have a positive and two

[01:41:12] **Speaker**: negatives or a negative and two

[01:41:13] **Speaker**: positives

[01:41:16] **Speaker**: just as we had the 147 right here we're

[01:41:18] **Speaker**: seeing

[01:41:20] **Speaker**: because in the third dimension it's a

[01:41:22] **Speaker**: little bit more complicated for the

[01:41:23] **Speaker**: family number groups the one and the

[01:41:25] **Speaker**: four and the Seven

[01:41:26] **Speaker**: are all positive

[01:41:28] **Speaker**: at the same time and in the 285s they're
all positive they're all negative at the 
[01:41:32] **Speaker**: same time

[01:41:34] **Speaker**: how this coil works is these windings

[01:41:36] **Speaker**: are wound in such a way

[01:41:38] **Speaker**: to create

[01:41:40] **Speaker**: that number here

[01:41:43] **Speaker**: that one wire

[01:41:46] **Speaker**: there's two wires here

[01:41:48] **Speaker**: that one wire all the positives are in

[01:41:52] **Speaker**: one wire at a minute that the first

[01:41:54] **Speaker**: stage there's three stages it's a firing

[01:41:56] **Speaker**: stage the first activation sequence of

[01:41:58] **Speaker**: this coil only the right wire is all

[01:42:00] **Speaker**: positive and that's the one four seven

[01:42:02] **Speaker**: so the second activation stage is all

[01:42:05] **Speaker**: your left wire is all positive it's

[01:42:07] **Speaker**: activated and now the first spamming

[01:42:09] **Speaker**: number group one for seven the other

[01:42:11] **Speaker**: wire is totally off and then they're

[01:42:13] **Speaker**: both off none of them are positive

[01:42:16] **Speaker**: they're all neither positive and the

[01:42:18] **Speaker**: middle space in there becomes all

[01:42:19] **Speaker**: positives the 396. I'm just preparing

[01:42:23] **Speaker**: you this this is like Advanced education

[01:42:24] **Speaker**: this is for what you're about to see not

[01:42:26] **Speaker**: what you've seen so far to relate it to

[01:42:29] **Speaker**: as long as we're finishing up on this

[01:42:31] **Speaker**: symbol okay I said I'd go to Vortex

[01:42:33] **Speaker**: motion I missed something because let me

[01:42:36] **Speaker**: let me just um

[01:42:41] **Speaker**: one four and seven are always fun no one

[01:42:46] **Speaker**: four sevens are always positive or one

[01:42:50] **Speaker**: four sevens are always negative right I

[01:42:52] **Speaker**: got you I got

[01:42:54] **Speaker**: that too but they as soon as it creates

[01:42:56] **Speaker**: a circuit it's a good question

[01:42:59] **Speaker**: this coil here the negative one four

[01:43:02] **Speaker**: sevens are all on the wire that the

[01:43:04] **Speaker**: positive eight two fives are on

[01:43:07] **Speaker**: you don't have and the positive A2 fives

[01:43:10] **Speaker**: and the positive one four sevens all

[01:43:12] **Speaker**: have the negative eight to the fives

[01:43:14] **Speaker**: they're so separated from one another

[01:43:16] **Speaker**: that that's why only one wire is on at

[01:43:18] **Speaker**: the other time because if both wires

[01:43:20] **Speaker**: have the same family number groups on at

[01:43:22] **Speaker**: the same time then this coil wouldn't

[01:43:24] **Speaker**: work it had resistance okay so that's

[01:43:28] **Speaker**: when the first wire is on it's all just

[01:43:30] **Speaker**: positive one four sevens and on that

[01:43:32] **Speaker**: wire there's only negative eight two

[01:43:34] **Speaker**: fives when the second wire is on it's

[01:43:36] **Speaker**: just all positive

[01:43:38] **Speaker**: um a25s and the negative one for sevens

[01:43:41] **Speaker**: are not it would help maybe if you draw
a picture of the wires that you're 
[01:43:44] **Speaker**: pointing to on that so that we can

[01:43:46] **Speaker**: understand there are two wires

[01:43:50] **Speaker**: different wire

[01:43:52] **Speaker**: and the windings that's right so there's

[01:43:55] **Speaker**: a red wire so to speak and the blue wire

[01:43:57] **Speaker**: I'll show you on a toroid I think it

[01:43:59] **Speaker**: should be easier for you the reason I

[01:44:01] **Speaker**: went so far ahead and told you now is

[01:44:03] **Speaker**: because I wanted you just to get a feel

[01:44:05] **Speaker**: how it related to the symbol that there

[01:44:08] **Speaker**: somehow eventually it's all connected to

[01:44:10] **Speaker**: this because I don't think that even

[01:44:12] **Speaker**: when you see the other one that you're

[01:44:14] **Speaker**: going to be able to understand exactly
how they tie it together 
[01:44:17] **Speaker**: so I

[01:44:19] **Speaker**: go ahead so you're saying the polarity

[01:44:21] **Speaker**: switch is when the current reverses its

[01:44:23] **Speaker**: direction

[01:44:25] **Speaker**: the emanations are always going out but

[01:44:28] **Speaker**: when I hit one wire the electricity goes
in one way when they hit it the other wire it goes in the opposite direction 
[01:44:32] **Speaker**: right but you have an alternating
current source 
[01:44:37] **Speaker**: but what makes it switch

[01:44:39] **Speaker**: it's not switching let's wait till we
see the torque 
[01:44:44] **Speaker**: discuss and we're the switch we have to

[01:44:45] **Speaker**: figure out how to for something didn't
you at the beginning forget it 
[01:44:57] **Speaker**: see this is what happens when I try and

[01:44:59] **Speaker**: explain something without a chart or a

[01:45:01] **Speaker**: graph so I'm not familiar with the way

[01:45:04] **Speaker**: the activation Secrets

[01:45:07] **Speaker**: electric field electricity through the
wires you've got two wires and that's 
[01:45:11] **Speaker**: the most important part you've got two

[01:45:12] **Speaker**: wires right just like in the plug you've

[01:45:15] **Speaker**: got two wires right this is what I'm

[01:45:17] **Speaker**: understanding okay you've got the

[01:45:19] **Speaker**: current that flows in and that's not two

[01:45:21] **Speaker**: wires

[01:45:23] **Speaker**: that's a single circuit

[01:45:25] **Speaker**: yeah but if in my case I have two

[01:45:29] **Speaker**: totally separate circuits so if I was

[01:45:31] **Speaker**: comparing this to a plug I would have

[01:45:33] **Speaker**: four wires using your analogy

[01:45:36] **Speaker**: okay
um 
[01:45:42] **Speaker**: they do not ever oh

[01:45:45] **Speaker**: yeah so the typical toroid would have

[01:45:47] **Speaker**: one wire is that what you're saying is

[01:45:49] **Speaker**: that typical yeah oh and you've used two

[01:45:53] **Speaker**: which is a by three one

[01:45:56] **Speaker**: with the space in between them right

[01:45:58] **Speaker**: because there's really three parts right

[01:46:00] **Speaker**: what that's created through the two

[01:46:03] **Speaker**: yeah it's hard to say right what came

[01:46:07] **Speaker**: first the field or the okay

[01:46:12] **Speaker**: all right so by creating the energy with

[01:46:15] **Speaker**: the two you get the third one okay so oh

[01:46:19] **Speaker**: I see it's underneath there okay yes I

[01:46:21] **Speaker**: have to kind of make room for it you

[01:46:23] **Speaker**: that's better put

[01:46:25] **Speaker**: yes it is displacing it is this is

[01:46:29] **Speaker**: making this make room for it and that

[01:46:32] **Speaker**: brings us back to this and that's why

[01:46:33] **Speaker**: I'm glad on this because this whole

[01:46:35] **Speaker**: thing all these numbers have an angle

[01:46:37] **Speaker**: and a ratio because they're making room

[01:46:39] **Speaker**: for this field it really brought me

[01:46:41] **Speaker**: right where I wanted to go because one

[01:46:43] **Speaker**: plus two equals three it has an angle I

[01:46:46] **Speaker**: take any two numbers add them together

[01:46:47] **Speaker**: and they're going to equal this flux

[01:46:49] **Speaker**: field

[01:46:51] **Speaker**: two plus four equals six

[01:46:55] **Speaker**: four plus eight is twelve but one plus

[01:46:58] **Speaker**: two is three h plus seven is fifteen but

[01:47:02] **Speaker**: one plus five is six see how I'm always

[01:47:03] **Speaker**: going through six three six seven plus

[01:47:05] **Speaker**: five is twelve which is three and five

[01:47:08] **Speaker**: plus one is six it's always three six

[01:47:10] **Speaker**: three six

[01:47:12] **Speaker**: it's because it's
being 
[01:47:15] **Speaker**: this

[01:47:16] **Speaker**: spread apart it's making room the one

[01:47:20] **Speaker**: through four eight seven five is making

[01:47:22] **Speaker**: room

[01:47:23] **Speaker**: for the 396. but they're two separate

[01:47:26] **Speaker**: systems

[01:47:27] **Speaker**: which we're going to be studying on

[01:47:30] **Speaker**: okay

[01:47:31] **Speaker**: okay it's a five billion people

[01:47:35] **Speaker**: didn't discover this probably a lot more

[01:47:38] **Speaker**: than that so it's it's okay that that

[01:47:41] **Speaker**: this making room concept seems a little
different 
[01:47:46] **Speaker**: okay

[01:47:47] **Speaker**: so I think I covered as much as I need

[01:47:50] **Speaker**: to cover on this symbol for the moment

[01:47:53] **Speaker**: and for the multiplication table

[01:47:56] **Speaker**: see and then yeah

[01:47:59] **Speaker**: uh

[01:48:02] **Speaker**: I think what I'd like to do though

[01:48:05] **Speaker**: is um

[01:48:07] **Speaker**: because

[01:48:09] **Speaker**: I'm really really

[01:48:14] **Speaker**: making your brains work to the max

[01:48:18] **Speaker**: this would normally not even be

[01:48:20] **Speaker**: explained but I just

[01:48:22] **Speaker**: want you to understand something I took

[01:48:25] **Speaker**: a circle here and I put one two three

[01:48:26] **Speaker**: four five six seven eight nine

[01:48:29] **Speaker**: okay that's called a control

[01:48:32] **Speaker**: okay because as as I could have done

[01:48:35] **Speaker**: two four six eight one three five seven

[01:48:37] **Speaker**: nine

[01:48:38] **Speaker**: okay and that's a new control do you
follow what I'm saying 
[01:48:43] **Speaker**: so it's very important that I

[01:48:44] **Speaker**: demonstrate to you that whatever your

[01:48:46] **Speaker**: control is you're still going to get the

[01:48:48] **Speaker**: same scientific

[01:48:52] **Speaker**: end results

[01:48:54] **Speaker**: so sure enough

[01:48:56] **Speaker**: there's your one two four eight seven

[01:48:58] **Speaker**: five it's very important that these

[01:49:00] **Speaker**: doubling circuits never go away they

[01:49:03] **Speaker**: have to exist in anything you know

[01:49:05] **Speaker**: Fibonacci Sequence past house triangle

[01:49:07] **Speaker**: uh pi

[01:49:10] **Speaker**: the golden means go everything we know

[01:49:13] **Speaker**: in science this has to be here biology

[01:49:16] **Speaker**: genetics periodic table it has to be

[01:49:20] **Speaker**: there along this is 396.

[01:49:23] **Speaker**: so the next control is four or five you
know there's only three multiplication I 
[01:49:27] **Speaker**: mean there's only six multiplication

[01:49:28] **Speaker**: series as far as one two four eight

[01:49:31] **Speaker**: seven five go as far as the third

[01:49:32] **Speaker**: dimension so I show those here spatial

[01:49:35] **Speaker**: orientation triangle is connected only

[01:49:36] **Speaker**: to vertex okay

[01:49:39] **Speaker**: oh we're gonna go to the vortex we

[01:49:42] **Speaker**: haven't done that yet okay so but sure

[01:49:45] **Speaker**: enough one two four eight seven five one

[01:49:47] **Speaker**: two four eight seven five one two four

[01:49:49] **Speaker**: eight seven five we have it

[01:49:52] **Speaker**: still there okay it's very important to

[01:49:55] **Speaker**: note that the one two four eight seven

[01:49:57] **Speaker**: five is going like this see how it's

[01:49:59] **Speaker**: always moving in the same way this

[01:50:00] **Speaker**: treadmill

[01:50:02] **Speaker**: because there's everything's based on

[01:50:04] **Speaker**: thirds and let me tell you this is why

[01:50:06] **Speaker**: we can't travel backwards in time and

[01:50:08] **Speaker**: this is why if things were based on a

[01:50:12] **Speaker**: duality in the universe would stop

[01:50:13] **Speaker**: flowing forward and this is why we

[01:50:15] **Speaker**: always eat

[01:50:16] **Speaker**: or we would die because it's called a

[01:50:20] **Speaker**: positive flow it's a stemic system our

[01:50:22] **Speaker**: systems are light it's systemic system

[01:50:24] **Speaker**: and the last thing you want to do is

[01:50:26] **Speaker**: back up because it moves only one way

[01:50:28] **Speaker**: which is straight on forward go ahead

[01:50:30] **Speaker**: you simply can't travel backwards in
time so all these rumors I've been 
[01:50:33] **Speaker**: hearing everywhere about time machines

[01:50:34] **Speaker**: is uh not writing your game it's certain

[01:50:37] **Speaker**: I do not there if they're moving

[01:50:40] **Speaker**: backwards in time they're not moving in

[01:50:41] **Speaker**: the created Universe of this universe oh

[01:50:43] **Speaker**: no I think they could be parallel

[01:50:45] **Speaker**: universities

[01:50:46] **Speaker**: um and I wouldn't even call in the

[01:50:48] **Speaker**: Universal soon and I don't know what's

[01:50:50] **Speaker**: going on but as far as this physical

[01:50:51] **Speaker**: Material World lots of time machines but

[01:50:54] **Speaker**: I am very very very cautious when I hear

[01:50:57] **Speaker**: about people going back in time I'm more
cautious about that anything else in 
[01:51:00] **Speaker**: fact most of the time I turn it off when
I hear it on the radio 
[01:51:05] **Speaker**: yes you can go ahead in time they do it
all the time 
[01:51:09] **Speaker**: and when you go ahead then how do you

[01:51:10] **Speaker**: get back you don't

[01:51:12] **Speaker**: you can get back but not to that moment

[01:51:16] **Speaker**: you can get back to a time that was not

[01:51:17] **Speaker**: going as fast as you so you can

[01:51:19] **Speaker**: accelerate it's like the Star Trek you

[01:51:21] **Speaker**: go forward in time uh have more time to

[01:51:24] **Speaker**: work on something because where you went

[01:51:26] **Speaker**: forward time is moving slower then come

[01:51:28] **Speaker**: back in time where the time was um

[01:51:31] **Speaker**: moving I said a vice versa

[01:51:34] **Speaker**: that's it right yeah

[01:51:37] **Speaker**: forwards in time where time is I think I

[01:51:40] **Speaker**: better not try that one

[01:51:43] **Speaker**: um in reality
when the astronauts has used something 
[01:51:47] **Speaker**: concrete when the astronauts went

[01:51:49] **Speaker**: forward in time I went and went into the

[01:51:51] **Speaker**: space they came back three seconds

[01:51:52] **Speaker**: younger whatever or appoint something

[01:51:54] **Speaker**: younger because in space you're farther

[01:51:57] **Speaker**: away

[01:51:58] **Speaker**: and math is a part of time and it a mass

[01:52:03] **Speaker**: affects other Mass the end because of
the positive emanations that's come from 
[01:52:07] **Speaker**: the center of all mass which are the

[01:52:08] **Speaker**: examination switch for modeling so on

[01:52:12] **Speaker**: Earth time is going faster than it is

[01:52:14] **Speaker**: going out on in outer space away from

[01:52:16] **Speaker**: Earth

[01:52:17] **Speaker**: so the astronauts then when they return

[01:52:20] **Speaker**: they're younger and conceivably they can

[01:52:23] **Speaker**: then we can actually perish like a
Planet of the Apes before they ever 
[01:52:28] **Speaker**: return

[01:52:29] **Speaker**: and uh when they return they can be
totally different people here and 
[01:52:33] **Speaker**: they're still alive

[01:52:34] **Speaker**: you can actually and thus they could

[01:52:36] **Speaker**: also go to another solar system to a

[01:52:39] **Speaker**: bigger planet like Jupiter where time is

[01:52:40] **Speaker**: actually faster towards its surface okay

[01:52:44] **Speaker**: so they can actually go there time will
um and they can actually um 
[01:52:50] **Speaker**: come back much older when they return

[01:52:53] **Speaker**: here

[01:52:54] **Speaker**: time is a relevant

[01:52:56] **Speaker**: um

[01:52:58] **Speaker**: ingredients to condensed matter physics

[01:53:01] **Speaker**: condense matter physics is based on your

[01:53:04] **Speaker**: axis your center of mass the number nine

[01:53:07] **Speaker**: the farther it all has to do with the

[01:53:10] **Speaker**: closer you are to the center of the mass

[01:53:12] **Speaker**: the faster of time the faster time goes

[01:53:15] **Speaker**: the farther away from the center of mass

[01:53:17] **Speaker**: the slower time goes the only thing is

[01:53:19] **Speaker**: there's one more ingredient to that

[01:53:21] **Speaker**: time is really moving the same

[01:53:23] **Speaker**: everywhere because the thing that's

[01:53:24] **Speaker**: controlling it is that frame of

[01:53:27] **Speaker**: reference from your distance so while

[01:53:29] **Speaker**: time is it's the fact that they're

[01:53:30] **Speaker**: changing the frame of references

[01:53:32] **Speaker**: okay that means that they're moving from

[01:53:34] **Speaker**: one time to another but in reality the

[01:53:37] **Speaker**: people on both locations Earth and

[01:53:40] **Speaker**: Jupiter they still have a year they

[01:53:42] **Speaker**: still have the same amount of time to

[01:53:43] **Speaker**: win it to themselves it's just that

[01:53:46] **Speaker**: their rules and measures change because

[01:53:48] **Speaker**: they're going to new frames of reference

[01:53:50] **Speaker**: okay now for instance I'll give you one

[01:53:52] **Speaker**: example time for us right now is

[01:53:55] **Speaker**: different than it was an hour let's say

[01:53:57] **Speaker**: when we start two hours ago how is time

[01:53:59] **Speaker**: different okay so we're expanding

[01:54:01] **Speaker**: sounding Universe time is really going

[01:54:03] **Speaker**: slower than when we started two hours

[01:54:05] **Speaker**: ago an hour right now is really five

[01:54:09] **Speaker**: hours now compared to two hours ago

[01:54:11] **Speaker**: would have been one hour because an hour

[01:54:13] **Speaker**: ago are there was less space between our

[01:54:16] **Speaker**: atoms two hours ago there's less our

[01:54:18] **Speaker**: molecules were more densely packed and

[01:54:21] **Speaker**: there and we were more condensed but

[01:54:24] **Speaker**: because we're still expanding all our

[01:54:26] **Speaker**: atoms evenly uniformly like a surface

[01:54:30] **Speaker**: film covering over the water expanded as

[01:54:33] **Speaker**: we moved away uniformly

[01:54:35] **Speaker**: so we don't see that time is changing

[01:54:37] **Speaker**: for us because the way that we're it's

[01:54:39] **Speaker**: relating to everything around us

[01:54:41] **Speaker**: everything's uniformly changing the

[01:54:43] **Speaker**: speed of time at the same time but in

[01:54:46] **Speaker**: reality as we're receding away we're

[01:54:48] **Speaker**: going through time frames where time

[01:54:50] **Speaker**: moves differently so it has to do with

[01:54:52] **Speaker**: quantum mechanics based on the decimal

[01:54:54] **Speaker**: system because these numbers all become

[01:54:56] **Speaker**: quantized very quickly

[01:54:58] **Speaker**: Okay so

[01:55:01] **Speaker**: and the reason they become quantized
because the hole in the center is off 
[01:55:04] **Speaker**: center

[01:55:05] **Speaker**: so it has to be spin array and it has to

[01:55:07] **Speaker**: explain the vortex and how things work

[01:55:09] **Speaker**: to comfort back inside okay we won't

[01:55:11] **Speaker**: struggle too hard on time except that I

[01:55:13] **Speaker**: was just going to show them that you

[01:55:15] **Speaker**: can't remember in the other chart that

[01:55:18] **Speaker**: everything was always moving this way

[01:55:21] **Speaker**: this way

[01:55:23] **Speaker**: and on this chart going backwards

[01:55:26] **Speaker**: we can never

[01:55:27] **Speaker**: ever make a multiplication series it

[01:55:30] **Speaker**: won't work

[01:55:31] **Speaker**: in other words the field the flux field

[01:55:35] **Speaker**: keeps the electrical only able to move

[01:55:38] **Speaker**: one way not backwards as far as time
goes 
[01:55:42] **Speaker**: and that also applies to how anything

[01:55:43] **Speaker**: moves through the universal matter or

[01:55:45] **Speaker**: living biological systems so how does

[01:55:47] **Speaker**: that work with energy through your body

[01:55:49] **Speaker**: like you know like uh Chinese I guess

[01:55:52] **Speaker**: Chinese medicine and that I guess it's

[01:55:54] **Speaker**: supposed to go like left to right the

[01:55:56] **Speaker**: cheese

[01:55:58] **Speaker**: back

[01:56:00] **Speaker**: up the left side around and down the
right side 
[01:56:10] **Speaker**: um there's a proper orientation of the

[01:56:12] **Speaker**: energy that David little was saying we

[01:56:16] **Speaker**: in the modern

[01:56:17] **Speaker**: a lot of times have reversed and we've

[01:56:21] **Speaker**: got it going to reverse order

[01:56:23] **Speaker**: the answer is just what Charlie said and

[01:56:26] **Speaker**: it deserves a lot of discussion it's

[01:56:28] **Speaker**: orientation and we haven't gotten to

[01:56:30] **Speaker**: that yet and that's the whole subject

[01:56:32] **Speaker**: seems like what you're saying is the

[01:56:34] **Speaker**: time moves one way and you're talking

[01:56:36] **Speaker**: about and we were just talking about

[01:56:40] **Speaker**: about the fact that physicists are what

[01:56:44] **Speaker**: he was just saying that this has just

[01:56:45] **Speaker**: been messing with the idea and the

[01:56:48] **Speaker**: phenomenon that you can reverse

[01:56:51] **Speaker**: anthropic and entropy which which really

[01:56:54] **Speaker**: is sort of the same thing as Time Zero

[01:56:57] **Speaker**: moving forward you can't undo

[01:56:59] **Speaker**: spontaneously what is sort of decayed

[01:57:02] **Speaker**: things Decay spontaneously in time

[01:57:08] **Speaker**: moving backwards

[01:57:11] **Speaker**: at the time something like that yeah I

[01:57:13] **Speaker**: don't agree with them

[01:57:14] **Speaker**: right yeah I don't know anything oh no

[01:57:18] **Speaker**: pretty well by the time we're done

[01:57:20] **Speaker**: I was just very brilliant but as far as

[01:57:23] **Speaker**: there's many things that I don't I'm

[01:57:25] **Speaker**: very careful not to endorse such as that

[01:57:28] **Speaker**: well he was talking about people who

[01:57:30] **Speaker**: were doing working

[01:57:32] **Speaker**: right I don't accept this

[01:57:35] **Speaker**: because because of the fact that the

[01:57:37] **Speaker**: numbers don't do that you're saying the

[01:57:39] **Speaker**: universe can't do that because you

[01:57:40] **Speaker**: cannot eliminate get rid of radiate

[01:57:43] **Speaker**: radiant emanation disintegration you

[01:57:45] **Speaker**: cannot suddenly

[01:57:48] **Speaker**: we

[01:57:50] **Speaker**: molecularly lies something that is

[01:57:53] **Speaker**: already demolecularized

[01:57:55] **Speaker**: but that's an accident it's just that

[01:57:58] **Speaker**: simple what you're saying right right

[01:58:00] **Speaker**: and you've come to that conclusion

[01:58:02] **Speaker**: because the numbers don't correspond

[01:58:04] **Speaker**: when you try to do it with the numbers
it doesn't work 
[01:58:08] **Speaker**: that's right these are all everything we

[01:58:11] **Speaker**: see here is a proof of evidence that
everything has to move forward now 
[01:58:14] **Speaker**: you're saying because of the way number

[01:58:15] **Speaker**: you're taking your model of the universe

[01:58:18] **Speaker**: based on the way numbers work and if the

[01:58:19] **Speaker**: numbers don't obey that then the

[01:58:21] **Speaker**: universe can't exactly exactly right

[01:58:24] **Speaker**: well that's for experience

[01:58:28] **Speaker**: create the creative Force it's not a
destructive forms self-evident 
[01:58:40] **Speaker**: um
spirit 
[01:58:45] **Speaker**: means

[01:58:47] **Speaker**: that everything works in the spiral

[01:58:50] **Speaker**: staircase

[01:58:53] **Speaker**: they created for
self-evident 
[01:59:05] **Speaker**: um
spirit 
[01:59:10] **Speaker**: means

[01:59:12] **Speaker**: that everything works in a spiral

[01:59:15] **Speaker**: staircase on a physical world

[01:59:18] **Speaker**: that means it's like in spiritual

[01:59:20] **Speaker**: qualities that means that instead of it

[01:59:23] **Speaker**: just being good or bad

[01:59:25] **Speaker**: you know black or white there's actually

[01:59:28] **Speaker**: three qualities

[01:59:30] **Speaker**: so what happens is that everything's

[01:59:32] **Speaker**: moving in a logarithmic spiral

[01:59:34] **Speaker**: so it's not a duality

[01:59:37] **Speaker**: and that's

[01:59:39] **Speaker**: why when we get stuck and we have to

[01:59:41] **Speaker**: make a decision and go forward in life

[01:59:42] **Speaker**: we always have other options you know we

[01:59:45] **Speaker**: think this is going to destroy us or

[01:59:47] **Speaker**: this is going to make it break us but

[01:59:49] **Speaker**: actually each thing leads to another
quality 
[01:59:52] **Speaker**: um

[01:59:53] **Speaker**: compassion leads to Mercy Mercy leads to

[01:59:56] **Speaker**: forgiveness forgiveness leads to uh

[02:00:01] **Speaker**: what would be the next one it's

[02:00:03] **Speaker**: different than just being a duality as

[02:00:04] **Speaker**: we tend to try and think of it

[02:00:08] **Speaker**: um the numbers three and six are

[02:00:11] **Speaker**: oscillating so one two four eight seven

[02:00:13] **Speaker**: five we've already seen this three six

[02:00:14] **Speaker**: three six three six

[02:00:16] **Speaker**: here we have 396-693 remember the

[02:00:18] **Speaker**: invisible field but sure enough three

[02:00:20] **Speaker**: six three six three six again a discrete

[02:00:23] **Speaker**: number cannot be created or destroyed

[02:00:25] **Speaker**: we're all comfortable with that

[02:00:27] **Speaker**: okay last thing before we take down this

[02:00:30] **Speaker**: chart

[02:00:31] **Speaker**: is the vortex
okay 
[02:00:36] **Speaker**: yeah

[02:00:38] **Speaker**: so

[02:00:39] **Speaker**: remember we came down like this

[02:00:43] **Speaker**: came out

[02:00:44] **Speaker**: came around like this

[02:00:46] **Speaker**: we're coming in

[02:00:48] **Speaker**: coming down coming out coming in around

[02:00:52] **Speaker**: okay what does this look like these

[02:00:54] **Speaker**: arrows are connecting here and they're

[02:00:58] **Speaker**: leaving there

[02:01:00] **Speaker**: okay

[02:01:02] **Speaker**: I need my assistance again

[02:01:10] **Speaker**: it is making an egg beater

[02:01:15] **Speaker**: okay we see this it is a vortex now what

[02:01:18] **Speaker**: does a Vortex do it takes matter and it

[02:01:21] **Speaker**: demolecularizes it whips it around and

[02:01:25] **Speaker**: brings it out now at the bottom in at

[02:01:28] **Speaker**: the top out at the bottom

[02:01:30] **Speaker**: did everybody see that yeah okay and

[02:01:34] **Speaker**: that's exactly thank you very much

[02:01:38] **Speaker**: that's exactly what is going on here

[02:01:41] **Speaker**: it's taking in at the top out at the

[02:01:43] **Speaker**: bottom in a vortex

[02:01:46] **Speaker**: okay in and out comes around again feeds

[02:01:50] **Speaker**: itself to renew it and that's how time

[02:01:53] **Speaker**: moves

[02:01:54] **Speaker**: this is the expanding Southern half of

[02:01:56] **Speaker**: the universe let's look at it on another
chart 
[02:02:09] **Speaker**: oh this chart gets saved in one second

[02:02:12] **Speaker**: so it's almost gonna go

[02:02:16] **Speaker**: but it gets safe

[02:02:18] **Speaker**: because I don't ever remember to make

[02:02:20] **Speaker**: this point it has to do with the vortex

[02:02:23] **Speaker**: again

[02:02:24] **Speaker**: I'm glad you're going to see it here is

[02:02:26] **Speaker**: a number two

[02:02:28] **Speaker**: see how the number two is a perfect

[02:02:30] **Speaker**: mirror of the number five do we all

[02:02:33] **Speaker**: agree with that okay but they're

[02:02:36] **Speaker**: inverted one's upside down

[02:02:39] **Speaker**: this point right here

[02:02:42] **Speaker**: is inverted

[02:02:44] **Speaker**: this is the inversion point

[02:02:46] **Speaker**: this is where everything gets

[02:02:49] **Speaker**: flip-flopped see how the number two is

[02:02:51] **Speaker**: over here and the number five is over

[02:02:52] **Speaker**: here

[02:02:54] **Speaker**: okay this is called God's Cosmic grinder

[02:03:00] **Speaker**: okay the cosmic grinder every black hole

[02:03:04] **Speaker**: feeds a rifle

[02:03:06] **Speaker**: okay every and the two and five are
opposites now the Ancients knew this they knew the simple they knew 
[02:03:13] **Speaker**: everything but they didn't share it with

[02:03:14] **Speaker**: the generality like mankind or mankind

[02:03:16] **Speaker**: just couldn't learn it I don't know what

[02:03:18] **Speaker**: the problem was

[02:03:19] **Speaker**: okay

[02:03:21] **Speaker**: but they left us a clue anyway now a lot
of people say hey this is artificial what are you talking about the shape of 
[02:03:26] **Speaker**: the symbol having anything to do with

[02:03:27] **Speaker**: the actual function in the shape but you

[02:03:29] **Speaker**: know doubling was how we were going that

[02:03:30] **Speaker**: way and you know happening was the other

[02:03:32] **Speaker**: way and it's not by accident they stuck

[02:03:34] **Speaker**: the five all the way down over here to

[02:03:37] **Speaker**: be a mirror of the two and that that

[02:03:39] **Speaker**: comes from them both connecting to the

[02:03:41] **Speaker**: one where they cannot

[02:03:42] **Speaker**: it's not an accident oh and then the

[02:03:45] **Speaker**: eight the other third part there's the

[02:03:47] **Speaker**: two one things still over the last side
yeah 
[02:03:54] **Speaker**: okay I would think so
yeah 
[02:04:02] **Speaker**: oh I said well when you combine the five

[02:04:05] **Speaker**: and the two uh they to get it form an 80
to uh 
[02:04:25] **Speaker**: I was thinking of when you get a half

[02:04:28] **Speaker**: you get 0.5 and that happened

[02:04:32] **Speaker**: everything's connected yeah

[02:04:38] **Speaker**: say one more time everything's connected

[02:04:41] **Speaker**: yeah but the the whole secret of that

[02:04:44] **Speaker**: information was kept very secret

[02:04:47] **Speaker**: I mean when you go back and you look at

[02:04:49] **Speaker**: bits pretty scared seeing things are you

[02:04:52] **Speaker**: wait a minute are you in the conspiracy

[02:04:55] **Speaker**: you know what I mean I've spent things

[02:04:57] **Speaker**: and seen little pieces of this and it

[02:04:59] **Speaker**: was a deep secret and a well-kept secret

[02:05:01] **Speaker**: but the swastika I mean their symbols

[02:05:04] **Speaker**: came out but they didn't understand the
significance of 
[02:05:08] **Speaker**: the

[02:05:09] **Speaker**: Eternal the eternal life of this one

[02:05:11] **Speaker**: well there's two there's the reverse

[02:05:13] **Speaker**: swats which means yeah there's two
shapes yeah 
[02:05:19] **Speaker**: they've been found in every continent

[02:05:21] **Speaker**: well we're dealing with mysticism and

[02:05:24] **Speaker**: actually that's my favorite topic is

[02:05:26] **Speaker**: showing how it relates to archeology and

[02:05:28] **Speaker**: Mystic symbols and that's my favorite

[02:05:30] **Speaker**: topic but I'm about to saturate you guys

[02:05:33] **Speaker**: and illness that's our family so

[02:05:36] **Speaker**: um

[02:05:37] **Speaker**: so you asked for it by bringing up that

[02:05:39] **Speaker**: stuff
but um 
[02:05:43] **Speaker**: but the point here is
is that 
[02:05:49] **Speaker**: they are reciprocals they always make

[02:05:51] **Speaker**: one and it has a use everything we're

[02:05:53] **Speaker**: seeing here has a use

[02:05:56] **Speaker**: and the use is this

[02:05:59] **Speaker**: okay the use is one times one is one two

[02:06:03] **Speaker**: times five is ten which equals one so I

[02:06:06] **Speaker**: go away from one one two which is a 4

[02:06:09] **Speaker**: and backwards one two which is a 7 and 4

[02:06:13] **Speaker**: times 7 is 28 which is ten which is a

[02:06:15] **Speaker**: one do you follow that okay I have to

[02:06:19] **Speaker**: just see I it's weird because I'm going

[02:06:21] **Speaker**: very long this way and very short just

[02:06:23] **Speaker**: go into adjacent nodes from the center

[02:06:25] **Speaker**: exactly from the one so I'm using the

[02:06:28] **Speaker**: one I'm not on the nine right now I'm on

[02:06:29] **Speaker**: the one we learned about polar

[02:06:31] **Speaker**: relationships which is by the nine so

[02:06:33] **Speaker**: now we're going to learn reciprocal

[02:06:34] **Speaker**: relationships the polar is different
from the reciprocal the reason I have 
[02:06:39] **Speaker**: the answer to everything is because I'm

[02:06:40] **Speaker**: combining every principle that exists

[02:06:42] **Speaker**: into one ball of yarn so right now we're

[02:06:45] **Speaker**: going to work not on the Polar aspect

[02:06:47] **Speaker**: but we're going to work on the

[02:06:49] **Speaker**: reciprocal reciprocal is always equal

[02:06:51] **Speaker**: the beginning Point okay one's the

[02:06:54] **Speaker**: beginning so 2 and 5 is the next

[02:06:57] **Speaker**: distance and 2 times 5 is 10 plus one

[02:07:00] **Speaker**: okay and so now I'm going to go four one

[02:07:03] **Speaker**: two which is the four two two lines away

[02:07:06] **Speaker**: bear in mind that every one of these

[02:07:07] **Speaker**: lines the ratio of this line to this

[02:07:09] **Speaker**: line to this line is your golden it's
all your means you could ever everything you want to know but you're starting 
[02:07:14] **Speaker**: with two and you're looking at one and

[02:07:16] **Speaker**: four in relationships no I'm not going

[02:07:18] **Speaker**: to do that yet I'm only counting I'm

[02:07:19] **Speaker**: going to take I'm going to start with

[02:07:21] **Speaker**: one I must end up on one and this must

[02:07:24] **Speaker**: be a one two because if this is a one I

[02:07:26] **Speaker**: want one times one is one watch I'm

[02:07:29] **Speaker**: gonna just do it okay one times one

[02:07:31] **Speaker**: equals one because this is really one

[02:07:33] **Speaker**: over one right okay so I go over here

[02:07:36] **Speaker**: and because I have two parts now I don't

[02:07:39] **Speaker**: have to multiply

[02:07:41] **Speaker**: two times two and well two times two is

[02:07:43] **Speaker**: four I've never done this before two

[02:07:45] **Speaker**: times two is four and five times five
seven 
[02:07:50] **Speaker**: is seven

[02:07:52] **Speaker**: and four times seven is twenties ten is

[02:07:54] **Speaker**: one yeah it's still worth ending with

[02:07:56] **Speaker**: okay it's okay I just thought I like to

[02:07:59] **Speaker**: do the things when I can find the things

[02:08:00] **Speaker**: to do because okay so four times seven

[02:08:04] **Speaker**: which is now two away from one one two

[02:08:08] **Speaker**: one two equals 28 which is ten which is

[02:08:11] **Speaker**: one and then I go one two three I end up

[02:08:14] **Speaker**: here this way and I go backwards one two

[02:08:17] **Speaker**: three this way so I go 8 times 8 is 64

[02:08:19] **Speaker**: is times one yeah always equals one and

[02:08:23] **Speaker**: I found that this shape always makes the

[02:08:26] **Speaker**: demarcation line it's called The Shear

[02:08:28] **Speaker**: it's called a um it's real important for

[02:08:31] **Speaker**: modeling electricity but I want I won't

[02:08:33] **Speaker**: go on to it further on the chart because

[02:08:35] **Speaker**: you'll see it elsewhere but since

[02:08:37] **Speaker**: Charlie you brought up one other thing

[02:08:39] **Speaker**: let's see what two now two times two is

[02:08:41] **Speaker**: four okay so I go this way one times

[02:08:44] **Speaker**: four is four then I gotta go like this

[02:08:46] **Speaker**: eight times five is forty which is four

[02:08:50] **Speaker**: and sometimes 7 is 49 which is four yeah

[02:08:52] **Speaker**: it's always going to be

[02:08:54] **Speaker**: sheer consistent and one time when

[02:08:57] **Speaker**: you're moving backwards one or anything

[02:08:58] **Speaker**: forward one and then the next time

[02:09:00] **Speaker**: you're moving backwards right forward

[02:09:02] **Speaker**: now 4 times 4 is 16 which is seven

[02:09:06] **Speaker**: so I go this way and I go what is it uh

[02:09:09] **Speaker**: 2 times 8 is 16 which is seven

[02:09:11] **Speaker**: and then one times seven is seven

[02:09:14] **Speaker**: and five times five is twenty-five which

[02:09:16] **Speaker**: is 7.

[02:09:18] **Speaker**: this whole thing's attractive I have a

[02:09:21] **Speaker**: chart in here that not only that I don't

[02:09:24] **Speaker**: have to say one word that is so

[02:09:26] **Speaker**: beautiful what's actually behind the

[02:09:28] **Speaker**: sport that you're gonna get the space

[02:09:30] **Speaker**: squared plus whatever you can

[02:09:33] **Speaker**: oh that's except that this whole thing

[02:09:36] **Speaker**: doesn't it also have its own Mirror
Image behind it 
[02:09:43] **Speaker**: yeah but but

[02:09:45] **Speaker**: and but it hasn't I'm listening to there

[02:09:47] **Speaker**: is no but yes it has a mirror image

[02:09:49] **Speaker**: there's certain laws or certain rules we

[02:09:51] **Speaker**: just have to understand what those are

[02:09:52] **Speaker**: you're you're already qualified now you

[02:09:55] **Speaker**: understand enough that you can tell me

[02:09:57] **Speaker**: what that mirror image is how that

[02:09:58] **Speaker**: mirror image works that's what we're

[02:10:00] **Speaker**: trying to go after is what is that I'm

[02:10:02] **Speaker**: here what's its polarity what's its

[02:10:04] **Speaker**: number what's its location based on up

[02:10:06] **Speaker**: down right and left front and back

[02:10:16] **Speaker**: they're here

[02:10:17] **Speaker**: well that's what I mean I'm here but in

[02:10:19] **Speaker**: another frame of mind like in another

[02:10:22] **Speaker**: another

[02:10:23] **Speaker**: type of um

[02:10:26] **Speaker**: it's all interrelated most of it the

[02:10:29] **Speaker**: only thing that's not a physical plane

[02:10:30] **Speaker**: is the 396's it gets easy we'll keep

[02:10:32] **Speaker**: working on it it's a little bit hard

[02:10:34] **Speaker**: right now because I started you from oil

[02:10:36] **Speaker**: as opposed to the map but we'll see

[02:10:42] **Speaker**: okay

[02:10:44] **Speaker**: I wasn't going to pull out this

[02:10:52] **Speaker**: I wasn't going to go into this but I

[02:10:54] **Speaker**: decided to do it now anyway

[02:10:56] **Speaker**: for the sake of thoroughness

[02:11:09] **Speaker**: okay we ready

[02:11:20] **Speaker**: this method of teaching is called

[02:11:23] **Speaker**: is called programming we are programming

[02:11:27] **Speaker**: you if we you will have 12 more hours of

[02:11:30] **Speaker**: this what's my place in all of this

[02:11:37] **Speaker**: what would your place what what is your

[02:11:40] **Speaker**: place in everything normally

[02:11:46] **Speaker**: okay

[02:11:47] **Speaker**: so you're a teacher that's right he says

[02:11:50] **Speaker**: go join if he says go out and join them
there's a tablet 
[02:11:56] **Speaker**: rejoined those tell them you know the

[02:12:00] **Speaker**: message

[02:12:01] **Speaker**: here we go one two four eight sixteen

[02:12:07] **Speaker**: it's a very primitive chart

[02:12:08] **Speaker**: the binary code is a six number digit

[02:12:11] **Speaker**: repeating pattern in the decimal system

[02:12:13] **Speaker**: one two four eight seven five this is

[02:12:15] **Speaker**: considered the binary code this is

[02:12:17] **Speaker**: computer switching they call it on and

[02:12:19] **Speaker**: off but I've already said zero is not

[02:12:21] **Speaker**: the member of any multiplication series

[02:12:24] **Speaker**: okay zero and one cannot be the

[02:12:27] **Speaker**: computers of the future

[02:12:29] **Speaker**: it just doesn't work that's why they're

[02:12:31] **Speaker**: so an obsolete okay and this toroid

[02:12:35] **Speaker**: system is the super computer but I'm

[02:12:38] **Speaker**: just showing one point which is the

[02:12:39] **Speaker**: score content versus quality is we have

[02:12:42] **Speaker**: one point here what is its content one

[02:12:45] **Speaker**: so there's your quality to the

[02:12:48] **Speaker**: right and content to the left got it now

[02:12:52] **Speaker**: we have two two points here what's their

[02:12:55] **Speaker**: content two does everyone understand

[02:12:57] **Speaker**: that no what's the quantity two

[02:13:00] **Speaker**: okay and what's their content of five

[02:13:04] **Speaker**: now we have that's what a reciprocal is

[02:13:09] **Speaker**: very well okay now we have four one two

[02:13:13] **Speaker**: three four

[02:13:15] **Speaker**: and what's their content Point 25 which

[02:13:19] **Speaker**: equals a seven okay
okay 
[02:13:26] **Speaker**: that's not point five point five because

[02:13:28] **Speaker**: we're only looking at each one there's

[02:13:30] **Speaker**: four one of these

[02:13:32] **Speaker**: okay and each one of those four

[02:13:35] **Speaker**: represent point one twenty five

[02:13:38] **Speaker**: no they represent 0.25 if you're looking

[02:13:41] **Speaker**: at the top one two three four

[02:13:43] **Speaker**: it is

[02:13:45] **Speaker**: I'm showing you that the binary system

[02:13:48] **Speaker**: is a pyramid but it's a pyramid that is

[02:13:49] **Speaker**: not binary if anything is

[02:13:53] **Speaker**: on the right is the branch number and on

[02:13:55] **Speaker**: the left is the uh yeah the value of of

[02:14:00] **Speaker**: the function so you create a little

[02:14:03] **Speaker**: Contraption

[02:14:04] **Speaker**: um makes a little Zippy that is

[02:14:07] **Speaker**: designed off of the Holy Name vibration
yeah 
[02:14:18] **Speaker**: that's all harmonic that's all it is
we even hear electricity when you're 
[02:14:27] **Speaker**: walking down the street on the pole

[02:14:29] **Speaker**: zapping has a great and frequency all

[02:14:31] **Speaker**: right so they're dabbling circuits in

[02:14:33] **Speaker**: Reverse directions so these doubling

[02:14:36] **Speaker**: circuits again are significant

[02:14:49] **Speaker**: all right I showed the vortex in house

[02:14:54] **Speaker**: last but least points

[02:14:56] **Speaker**: which is not going to be I'm sure the

[02:14:58] **Speaker**: two and five is not accidents as long as

[02:15:01] **Speaker**: we're on these charts I'm showing the

[02:15:03] **Speaker**: vortex action

[02:15:05] **Speaker**: I'm showing how it moves in a vortex

[02:15:08] **Speaker**: showing Infinity is this a cosmic

[02:15:11] **Speaker**: grinder

[02:15:12] **Speaker**: okay I'm showing the music scale plastic

[02:15:15] **Speaker**: musical scale is the doubling circuits

[02:15:17] **Speaker**: too from C to C to C is one uh 128 which

[02:15:21] **Speaker**: is 11 which is 2 256 13 4 5 12 is eight

[02:15:25] **Speaker**: same thing

[02:15:27] **Speaker**: your doubling circuits

[02:15:29] **Speaker**: I said the Ancients did know this and

[02:15:31] **Speaker**: that pretty much sums that up right

[02:15:33] **Speaker**: there

[02:15:35] **Speaker**: okay

[02:15:36] **Speaker**: five one
uh 
[02:15:40] **Speaker**: two

[02:15:42] **Speaker**: 128 11 2 3 6 13 4 5 12 8 1024. seven

[02:15:47] **Speaker**: remember seven always comes after the

[02:15:49] **Speaker**: eight not before one two four eight

[02:15:51] **Speaker**: seven five

[02:15:53] **Speaker**: okay

[02:15:54] **Speaker**: do you have that sunshine

[02:16:00] **Speaker**: real quick okay pull your chair a little

[02:16:09] **Speaker**: it would be like a mental doggie bag

[02:16:14] **Speaker**: just squeeze her in the middle actually

[02:16:17] **Speaker**: take a second and let's make Sunshine

[02:16:19] **Speaker**: squeeze in here

[02:16:20] **Speaker**: okay there you go nothing I'm close

[02:16:23] **Speaker**: enough intellectual enzymes you turn

[02:16:25] **Speaker**: your chair a little bit like this

[02:16:32] **Speaker**: figure this out

[02:16:35] **Speaker**: instead of using ones and zeros instead

[02:16:37] **Speaker**: of nines well that's the point foreign

[02:17:22] **Speaker**: like what like three six nine Jesus

[02:17:25] **Speaker**: it isn't what they already know it's the

[02:17:28] **Speaker**: fact they've never unified it right

[02:17:30] **Speaker**: right you've never been I haven't ever

[02:17:32] **Speaker**: seen it like this yeah yeah right that's

[02:17:34] **Speaker**: the promise they can't see what the

[02:17:37] **Speaker**: universe is doing they say oh maybe it's

[02:17:39] **Speaker**: expanding maybe it's going to keep on

[02:17:41] **Speaker**: going forever maybe it's going to

[02:17:42] **Speaker**: collapse on itself they don't know

[02:17:45] **Speaker**: okay I do know this you're gonna know

[02:17:47] **Speaker**: with this
okay 
[02:17:54] **Speaker**: okay I would like to apply this a lot to

[02:17:57] **Speaker**: computers but did you get that point

[02:17:59] **Speaker**: right there on the music scale yet

[02:18:06] **Speaker**: you got it I will so it's my thirds yeah

[02:18:12] **Speaker**: I'm sorry

[02:18:14] **Speaker**: I'm sorry it's not your fault the charge

[02:18:16] **Speaker**: is too slow

[02:18:18] **Speaker**: I'm gonna say it again
Cycles 
[02:18:25] **Speaker**: just down there there's 256 cycles per

[02:18:28] **Speaker**: second proceed if you add two five and

[02:18:31] **Speaker**: six we get you get um

[02:18:34] **Speaker**: and three plus one is four and four

[02:18:37] **Speaker**: equals the equation of all of the things

[02:18:42] **Speaker**: what are the others exactly what are the

[02:18:44] **Speaker**: other numbers 512 is your next C which
is eight and you know four there's eight 
[02:18:48] **Speaker**: and you know seven always comes out

[02:18:50] **Speaker**: great the next C is 1024.
so 
[02:19:02] **Speaker**: okay so sure enough we got 2 000 48 is

[02:19:07] **Speaker**: the next frequency of C two and four six

[02:19:09] **Speaker**: eight six fourteen one plus four is five

[02:19:13] **Speaker**: does that work with the others

[02:19:15] **Speaker**: with a and

[02:19:18] **Speaker**: um one of the other octaves they're the

[02:19:20] **Speaker**: same the same distance actually

[02:19:22] **Speaker**: everything that I'm explaining I'm not a

[02:19:24] **Speaker**: musician so I've never even written a

[02:19:26] **Speaker**: paper on how this relates to music

[02:19:28] **Speaker**: because you see how much there is

[02:19:30] **Speaker**: already that we've and there's so much I

[02:19:33] **Speaker**: actually am hoping that sunshine

[02:19:35] **Speaker**: I hate to say Sunshine but I'm retiring

[02:19:38] **Speaker**: after this talk this evening and you're

[02:19:40] **Speaker**: gonna have to do the work on explaining

[02:19:42] **Speaker**: it on the music scale because musicians

[02:19:44] **Speaker**: could be a whole group of people that

[02:19:46] **Speaker**: you could be teaching about

[02:19:48] **Speaker**: the number nine and how it relates to

[02:19:52] **Speaker**: um metaphysics and Divinity and things

[02:19:56] **Speaker**: so essentially what I'll do is I'm just
giving her 
[02:20:08] **Speaker**: the next one up and then the doubling of
that would be um 
[02:20:17] **Speaker**: that's pretty powerful now so when we

[02:20:19] **Speaker**: listen to music and they say it's the

[02:20:20] **Speaker**: wings of the high scripture it says it's

[02:20:23] **Speaker**: the wings of the Soul uh to the heavens

[02:20:27] **Speaker**: the spiritual wings so it really is

[02:20:31] **Speaker**: electromagnetically in harmonics

[02:20:34] **Speaker**: now I'll tell you something that um we
have a question here but I'll tell you 
[02:20:39] **Speaker**: something that auster did say he was

[02:20:40] **Speaker**: exactly right he said that um

[02:20:44] **Speaker**: I forgot

[02:20:46] **Speaker**: he said that that the harmonics

[02:20:51] **Speaker**: and I forgot oh well you were right

[02:20:53] **Speaker**: Alistair go ahead

[02:20:56] **Speaker**: um so it kind of sounds like what you're

[02:20:59] **Speaker**: giving us is like the theory that can be

[02:21:01] **Speaker**: applied to every part of our culture

[02:21:03] **Speaker**: whether it's science math music religion

[02:21:07] **Speaker**: it's basically yeah so the thing

[02:21:10] **Speaker**: everybody's looking for I'm giving you

[02:21:12] **Speaker**: your attache case

[02:21:16] **Speaker**: just watch out for the gun that shoots

[02:21:18] **Speaker**: backwards yeah yeah it's like

[02:21:25] **Speaker**: that's right

[02:21:26] **Speaker**: that's right that's really correct

[02:21:28] **Speaker**: thanks the meaning

[02:21:31] **Speaker**: of life to ask the questions why do we

[02:21:35] **Speaker**: live what is our purpose what is our

[02:21:37] **Speaker**: goal where are we going to where what do

[02:21:40] **Speaker**: we come from how about Mr an idea can

[02:21:43] **Speaker**: you talking about the nine the six and

[02:21:46] **Speaker**: the three and when the nine is positive

[02:21:48] **Speaker**: and 63 are both negative that's um some

[02:21:52] **Speaker**: friends of ours that came from Los

[02:21:54] **Speaker**: Angeles uh spoke they were the highs and

[02:21:56] **Speaker**: they were explaining how

[02:21:58] **Speaker**: um two people that are in love if they

[02:22:01] **Speaker**: are focusing on God they're like little

[02:22:03] **Speaker**: mirrors and they're reflecting the light

[02:22:05] **Speaker**: towards God and yet if they're focusing

[02:22:08] **Speaker**: on themselves or each other too much

[02:22:10] **Speaker**: then they're not reflecting the light

[02:22:13] **Speaker**: and they're not getting anything either

[02:22:16] **Speaker**: from that so if you're you know if

[02:22:18] **Speaker**: you're

[02:22:20] **Speaker**: dwelling on yourself too much you can't

[02:22:22] **Speaker**: be absorbing it in any of this good

[02:22:25] **Speaker**: energy which is also like this because

[02:22:27] **Speaker**: when you think about it these two things

[02:22:30] **Speaker**: that are negative they're actually

[02:22:31] **Speaker**: receiving that's right and also if they

[02:22:34] **Speaker**: were positive they're actually X's

[02:22:38] **Speaker**: it which means X's is like negative in a
way positives are negative you know what 
[02:22:43] **Speaker**: I mean

[02:22:44] **Speaker**: you're I don't know what you mean but I

[02:22:47] **Speaker**: know you're completely right I don't

[02:22:49] **Speaker**: know what you mean by X's but you're

[02:22:51] **Speaker**: exactly right they are receiving it's

[02:22:52] **Speaker**: like an X

[02:22:54] **Speaker**: a positive sign like a cross

[02:22:58] **Speaker**: right so it means you're wrong when

[02:23:01] **Speaker**: you're actually thinking that you're so

[02:23:03] **Speaker**: good not to be receiving like you should

[02:23:05] **Speaker**: be receiving from them

[02:23:09] **Speaker**: you've got to always be tapping and

[02:23:11] **Speaker**: receiving you gotta hold on to it

[02:23:13] **Speaker**: completely even in your sleep that's

[02:23:14] **Speaker**: right you've always gotta it's called

[02:23:16] **Speaker**: your invisible

[02:23:17] **Speaker**: core that connects you and you don't

[02:23:21] **Speaker**: want you always want to be able to be

[02:23:22] **Speaker**: focused and at your representative focal

[02:23:25] **Speaker**: centers being an athlete when you're

[02:23:26] **Speaker**: moving and you're exercising but when

[02:23:28] **Speaker**: you're praying or worshiping and the

[02:23:30] **Speaker**: highest form is to know the name of God

[02:23:32] **Speaker**: and intimate it and touch into that

[02:23:34] **Speaker**: vibration
um 
[02:23:38] **Speaker**: what you just said is really right

[02:23:41] **Speaker**: another example is um like when we look

[02:23:44] **Speaker**: out in the ocean and the moon's on it we

[02:23:46] **Speaker**: see the sea of seventy thousand lights

[02:23:48] **Speaker**: they look like little lanterns but we

[02:23:50] **Speaker**: know in reality they're all reflecting

[02:23:52] **Speaker**: from just that one noon okay they and

[02:23:55] **Speaker**: they're all and the only time we see

[02:23:56] **Speaker**: that little reflection is when those

[02:23:58] **Speaker**: facets

[02:23:59] **Speaker**: are at the right angle it's like a

[02:24:03] **Speaker**: Swarovski Austrian leaded crystal prism

[02:24:05] **Speaker**: okay there there the crystal glows and

[02:24:09] **Speaker**: has a fire on it because the facets are

[02:24:12] **Speaker**: all focused they'll have the epicenter

[02:24:15] **Speaker**: they're all Prismatic they're a mirror

[02:24:16] **Speaker**: these numbers everything I've really

[02:24:18] **Speaker**: come here is about to turn into a prism

[02:24:20] **Speaker**: behind this sheath is a prism

[02:24:23] **Speaker**: with immense passes

[02:24:26] **Speaker**: and Charlie's seen that prison so he

[02:24:29] **Speaker**: knows what's going on and

[02:24:32] **Speaker**: um when you're about to see it too

[02:24:34] **Speaker**: before we go to that prison was one more

[02:24:37] **Speaker**: thing then that we should cover

[02:24:40] **Speaker**: um I just want to say that I cracked the
code to the underground but we won't try 
[02:24:43] **Speaker**: and do it you were going to talk about

[02:24:45] **Speaker**: the touring in computers but I honestly

[02:24:48] **Speaker**: think that the best application of my
work is to Computer Sciences that's what 
[02:24:52] **Speaker**: I'm going to be speaking at the Maui

[02:24:53] **Speaker**: computer center and maybe if you have
the time you'll come I'm a little 
[02:24:57] **Speaker**: frightened that most of them won't

[02:24:59] **Speaker**: understand what I'm going to say if you

[02:25:00] **Speaker**: don't come it's fine only thing is is

[02:25:03] **Speaker**: that there is no board here other than

[02:25:06] **Speaker**: me showing a few fractals which you were

[02:25:08] **Speaker**: interested in artificial intelligence I

[02:25:10] **Speaker**: don't address the computers

[02:25:13] **Speaker**: um I do address it I don't

[02:25:15] **Speaker**: do it is the difference I didn't make

[02:25:18] **Speaker**: these coils there has to be a computer

[02:25:20] **Speaker**: inventors and programmers and softwares

[02:25:22] **Speaker**: that are going to have to do this I

[02:25:24] **Speaker**: don't have the I don't have the

[02:25:26] **Speaker**: resources to start working on computers

[02:25:28] **Speaker**: if I had a laboratory if I had a budget

[02:25:30] **Speaker**: in an office and all that stuff I'd be

[02:25:32] **Speaker**: applying it to computers and Technology

[02:25:34] **Speaker**: a lot of people want to apply my work to

[02:25:36] **Speaker**: that I do have the answer but so I'm not

[02:25:39] **Speaker**: going to jump into the touring right now

[02:25:45] **Speaker**: stay safe there's nothing I can do about

[02:25:48] **Speaker**: that yeah I bulletproof vest you know

[02:25:51] **Speaker**: what it really is

[02:25:52] **Speaker**: you're gonna say something to me

[02:25:56] **Speaker**: okay but I feel bad staying up that I
didn't go into the touring so what do you want to say about the touring when 
[02:26:01] **Speaker**: you showed the binary assistant rules

[02:26:03] **Speaker**: the one two and seven uh

[02:26:06] **Speaker**: hello you know it's like it doesn't work

[02:26:09] **Speaker**: and there are no zeros and how how smart

[02:26:13] **Speaker**: you have to be to see that yeah I know

[02:26:15] **Speaker**: it's shocking

[02:26:16] **Speaker**: I mean that's I mean that because what
they're doing is they're teaching 
[02:26:20] **Speaker**: they're saying things in science

[02:26:21] **Speaker**: predicated on things that are um

[02:26:24] **Speaker**: fallacious and it's just amazing in

[02:26:26] **Speaker**: other words they are um they are fudging

[02:26:29] **Speaker**: I don't have your eye too far

[02:26:31] **Speaker**: okay now

[02:26:33] **Speaker**: here's the thing

[02:26:37] **Speaker**: if you're worried about protecting

[02:26:39] **Speaker**: yourself then you don't have the time to

[02:26:40] **Speaker**: be doing other things so I've ignored
that issue too 
[02:26:49] **Speaker**: quantize from relativistic to Quantum he

[02:26:52] **Speaker**: actually said that he had a funny saying
he says they're actually going to be 
[02:26:56] **Speaker**: very frightened of me which they are

[02:26:57] **Speaker**: because he said that they took somebody

[02:26:59] **Speaker**: out of the right field that came in
through the side door from another 
[02:27:02] **Speaker**: approach because they haven't been able

[02:27:04] **Speaker**: to solve it that makes sense that

[02:27:05] **Speaker**: somebody that was off the wall would

[02:27:08] **Speaker**: figure it out and that's the problem

[02:27:11] **Speaker**: so I've never had a threat from any

[02:27:14] **Speaker**: government or agency ever and I have had

[02:27:18] **Speaker**: a few scientists get drunk as when

[02:27:21] **Speaker**: there's sober semi works the best and
most wonderful they've ever seen and 
[02:27:24] **Speaker**: stuff like that and how could they have

[02:27:25] **Speaker**: not have read my book six months sooner

[02:27:27] **Speaker**: or this and that and then when they got

[02:27:29] **Speaker**: drunk they called me you this you that I
can't remember all things to say but 
[02:27:32] **Speaker**: about the 20th word was a scandal with

[02:27:34] **Speaker**: Scotsman and my best friend was with me

[02:27:36] **Speaker**: really person to laugh was on that

[02:27:39] **Speaker**: call me everything in the book

[02:27:41] **Speaker**: so I like that I don't know

[02:27:44] **Speaker**: so okay

[02:27:47] **Speaker**: um so we did cover this chart which I

[02:27:49] **Speaker**: normally forget

[02:27:51] **Speaker**: um

[02:27:53] **Speaker**: you couldn't even touch this unless we

[02:27:55] **Speaker**: have the toroid maybe we'll come back to

[02:27:57] **Speaker**: it I'll leave it up here maybe not we'll

[02:28:00] **Speaker**: see because it is interesting how it

[02:28:03] **Speaker**: relates this to the toilet okay

[02:28:07] **Speaker**: we are now then going to

[02:28:10] **Speaker**: pull it down and we're about to get
complicated okay 
[02:28:18] **Speaker**: everybody ready
I'll wait one second right 
[02:28:32] **Speaker**: very good one

[02:28:36] **Speaker**: okay you guys over there just a sec

[02:28:39] **Speaker**: you ready

[02:28:41] **Speaker**: we need your help we need your help to

[02:28:44] **Speaker**: be honest okay I'm gonna want you guys

[02:28:47] **Speaker**: to chart the way this is Judy and
Charlie I'm going to want you to chart 
[02:28:52] **Speaker**: the way

[02:28:53] **Speaker**: how this choroid rate I mean how this

[02:28:56] **Speaker**: sembling right here is going to be a

[02:28:58] **Speaker**: three a dimensional system we're going

[02:29:00] **Speaker**: to try and take everybody into Dimension

[02:29:02] **Speaker**: now okay because all this has ever been

[02:29:04] **Speaker**: is a flat straight line cross section of

[02:29:07] **Speaker**: a circle okay we're going to now take

[02:29:10] **Speaker**: them into Dimension and Charlie knows

[02:29:12] **Speaker**: how a little bit yeah I remember from

[02:29:15] **Speaker**: yesterday a little bit about that okay

[02:29:19] **Speaker**: he has great students they're focused

[02:29:22] **Speaker**: they're concentrated I'll ask them what

[02:29:25] **Speaker**: they remember yeah okay big problem

[02:29:27] **Speaker**: Willow I'm sure remember

[02:29:37] **Speaker**: we have right here so I'm telling you
the answer before we go with Charlie we're all going to try and help you understand 
[02:29:42] **Speaker**: this right here the reason these two

[02:29:45] **Speaker**: points are different than these two

[02:29:46] **Speaker**: points as this is telling you simply

[02:29:48] **Speaker**: nothing fancy this is a coordinate

[02:29:50] **Speaker**: system a simple coordinate system you

[02:29:53] **Speaker**: have an x y z axis

[02:29:55] **Speaker**: okay okay this is your X this is your Y

[02:29:59] **Speaker**: and this is your Z everyone follow that

[02:30:02] **Speaker**: you see it come down Z comes out at you

[02:30:05] **Speaker**: like that it's the dandelion tough

[02:30:07] **Speaker**: principle it's really coming out this

[02:30:09] **Speaker**: way this way but it's in the phasing of

[02:30:10] **Speaker**: thirds

[02:30:12] **Speaker**: clearance means is it's coming out

[02:30:16] **Speaker**: this one's little this is medium this is

[02:30:19] **Speaker**: long and the next one coming out to it

[02:30:21] **Speaker**: if this is representing a tile or space

[02:30:24] **Speaker**: there's going to be one two

[02:30:27] **Speaker**: three before that space is ever

[02:30:31] **Speaker**: activated again it's always in thirds so

[02:30:33] **Speaker**: they're just not shooting out randomly

[02:30:36] **Speaker**: it's really I'm so privileged with the

[02:30:40] **Speaker**: understanding to be able to mentally

[02:30:42] **Speaker**: think of this because when I was just a

[02:30:44] **Speaker**: little kid I wouldn't I saw the books

[02:30:46] **Speaker**: they wrote at this the most advanced

[02:30:47] **Speaker**: professor in the world Eddington and I

[02:30:49] **Speaker**: he was a wonderful guy but it was it was

[02:30:52] **Speaker**: just it was the same as your children

[02:30:54] **Speaker**: telling you a story at night before you

[02:30:57] **Speaker**: go it was like uh it was like um Alvin

[02:30:59] **Speaker**: and Clive's and what is it small Dewey

[02:31:02] **Speaker**: hamster you know he gets his head chewed

[02:31:04] **Speaker**: off at the end it was a hamster story

[02:31:07] **Speaker**: everything's a hamster story so I really

[02:31:09] **Speaker**: feel blessed to be able to get out of

[02:31:13] **Speaker**: the hamster story and learn about how

[02:31:15] **Speaker**: this energy sprays out it's like a

[02:31:17] **Speaker**: fountain it's the Fountain of Life

[02:31:19] **Speaker**: Okay so

[02:31:22] **Speaker**: the X acts but now it turns out what I'm

[02:31:25] **Speaker**: doing is I'm doing an x coordinate

[02:31:27] **Speaker**: system and it's going to be all your

[02:31:28] **Speaker**: family number groups of one and it's
going to be all your family number 
[02:31:31] **Speaker**: groups of

[02:31:33] **Speaker**: uh 4 on the Y so I better Circle my
number because it's becoming messy am I this one right here is going to be my 
[02:31:40] **Speaker**: family number groups of seven see the
same 
[02:31:44] **Speaker**: four is part of the one group nah

[02:31:47] **Speaker**: because they occupy different points it

[02:31:51] **Speaker**: is the same they're the same family

[02:31:53] **Speaker**: number group right but we're not talking

[02:31:55] **Speaker**: about family number groups right now I'm

[02:31:57] **Speaker**: showing you how the spatial orientation

[02:31:58] **Speaker**: how this point is so significant from

[02:32:00] **Speaker**: this these are all the planes

[02:32:03] **Speaker**: so one and eight you're going to say

[02:32:05] **Speaker**: your equivalent now in this system

[02:32:08] **Speaker**: or what we're getting there

[02:32:10] **Speaker**: it's pretty quick word I might say that

[02:32:12] **Speaker**: the most brilliant seismic engineer and

[02:32:15] **Speaker**: architect in Mexico looked at this and

[02:32:18] **Speaker**: he just knew what it was immediately I

[02:32:20] **Speaker**: wish I was as smart as him

[02:32:22] **Speaker**: took me years he said it was all the

[02:32:25] **Speaker**: planes of spatial orientation

[02:32:27] **Speaker**: okay and you're doing it fast because

[02:32:29] **Speaker**: you're you've already jumped to the

[02:32:30] **Speaker**: eight where is he one and eight here I

[02:32:33] **Speaker**: certain post a double coordinate system

[02:32:35] **Speaker**: this is your eight

[02:32:37] **Speaker**: this is now your five remember four and

[02:32:40] **Speaker**: fives are opposites and this

[02:32:43] **Speaker**: is actually it's not going it's going to

[02:32:46] **Speaker**: reverse

[02:32:47] **Speaker**: this is your

[02:32:50] **Speaker**: two

[02:32:52] **Speaker**: okay and everything about them is

[02:32:55] **Speaker**: opposite in reverses this one okay

[02:32:59] **Speaker**: you're about to see how it works yeah

[02:33:01] **Speaker**: that's right what about it did you if

[02:33:03] **Speaker**: you're eight and one one to seven

[02:33:05] **Speaker**: whatever here's your four and five I
know it's getting a little difficult 
[02:33:08] **Speaker**: everybody it'll be easier in a minute oh

[02:33:10] **Speaker**: okay okay

[02:33:12] **Speaker**: and I put two coordinate systems

[02:33:14] **Speaker**: together to make a stereograph see how

[02:33:16] **Speaker**: we have red and blue here so I'm about

[02:33:18] **Speaker**: now remember if you have stereo you got

[02:33:20] **Speaker**: Dimension and feel and displacement and

[02:33:23] **Speaker**: Surround Sound and okay

[02:33:28] **Speaker**: yes Charlie you ready yeah well we're

[02:33:32] **Speaker**: gonna it's happening anyway eight and

[02:33:34] **Speaker**: one is going to be your x-axis four and

[02:33:38] **Speaker**: five is your y-axis and seven and two is

[02:33:41] **Speaker**: your z-axis

[02:33:42] **Speaker**: you reverse the color so

[02:33:47] **Speaker**: um I'm not doing family number groups

[02:33:48] **Speaker**: I'm doing I didn't regression

[02:33:51] **Speaker**: I'm showing one and eight it's like

[02:33:53] **Speaker**: altitude now

[02:33:54] **Speaker**: yeah it's more complicated it's a good

[02:33:57] **Speaker**: try but it's more comfortable it

[02:33:58] **Speaker**: explains why altitude exists though

[02:34:00] **Speaker**: huh

[02:34:03] **Speaker**: but it's a different color now that's

[02:34:05] **Speaker**: right because you'll get it pretty quick

[02:34:07] **Speaker**: okay we're gonna lose this one if you

[02:34:09] **Speaker**: need to see it it reverse the colors

[02:34:11] **Speaker**: there you go of course they're not

[02:34:13] **Speaker**: colorized
that's easy 
[02:34:40] **Speaker**: that's just

[02:34:42] **Speaker**: this seven one four

[02:34:45] **Speaker**: one seven four you've taken what was

[02:34:47] **Speaker**: Pink and you've made that family into

[02:34:50] **Speaker**: blue what matters right now is that yeah

[02:34:54] **Speaker**: I just changed the same color

[02:34:55] **Speaker**: arbitrarily okay

[02:34:58] **Speaker**: there's nothing arbitrary in the

[02:35:00] **Speaker**: universe but yes

[02:35:02] **Speaker**: you are correct okay

[02:35:05] **Speaker**: and I've never erased in a class before

[02:35:09] **Speaker**: until now

[02:35:12] **Speaker**: but here we go

[02:35:14] **Speaker**: thank you

[02:35:16] **Speaker**: okay I appreciate

[02:35:19] **Speaker**: meticulousness so this is a one this is

[02:35:23] **Speaker**: a

[02:35:25] **Speaker**: number four times

[02:35:30] **Speaker**: I did it wrong again one

[02:35:35] **Speaker**: because it should be all red make them
happy 
[02:35:42] **Speaker**: oh and I'll put 285 in the blue so it

[02:35:45] **Speaker**: matches the chart

[02:35:46] **Speaker**: and I hope you'll never let this happen
again 
[02:35:53] **Speaker**: what is it two and five thanks but he's

[02:35:56] **Speaker**: right
you got it 
[02:36:03] **Speaker**: the difference

[02:36:05] **Speaker**: vertical levels on me not critical

[02:36:08] **Speaker**: levels the horizontally lining up the
just getting is because there's an 
[02:36:11] **Speaker**: energy we'll come back to that I'm

[02:36:13] **Speaker**: saying that this is showing x y z this

[02:36:15] **Speaker**: is totally different right but you've

[02:36:17] **Speaker**: taken that from the fact that there are

[02:36:18] **Speaker**: compliments of each other that they're

[02:36:20] **Speaker**: different on the corresponding Corners
mirrored though 
[02:36:24] **Speaker**: yes

[02:36:25] **Speaker**: we're comfortable with that

[02:36:28] **Speaker**: okay

[02:36:29] **Speaker**: so so Judy I need your help please

[02:36:33] **Speaker**: to remove this one and this one will not

[02:36:35] **Speaker**: be too easy to take down because we put

[02:36:37] **Speaker**: it on a Little Bit Stronger

[02:36:41] **Speaker**: what I'm about to show you I'll tell you

[02:36:43] **Speaker**: real quick is we're going to show you

[02:36:45] **Speaker**: this coordinate system stereographic

[02:36:47] **Speaker**: everything overlapping we're going to

[02:36:49] **Speaker**: show you the skin of the Taurus we're

[02:36:51] **Speaker**: going to show you how this all works now

[02:36:54] **Speaker**: and it's it's not going to be too easy

[02:37:04] **Speaker**: oh my God
um 
[02:37:20] **Speaker**: so all this was just to prepare you for
this 
[02:37:33] **Speaker**: thank you

[02:37:35] **Speaker**: okay oops

[02:37:42] **Speaker**: but I had promised you to go into

[02:37:45] **Speaker**: vortexes which are more fun

[02:37:49] **Speaker**: our hero

[02:37:52] **Speaker**: the White Knight vortex

[02:37:56] **Speaker**: all right

[02:37:58] **Speaker**: so

[02:38:00] **Speaker**: are you missing one person

[02:38:03] **Speaker**: oh yeah

[02:38:04] **Speaker**: okay so here we go

[02:38:07] **Speaker**: we have the vortex we ready

[02:38:11] **Speaker**: okay

[02:38:13] **Speaker**: a Vortex is compressing

[02:38:17] **Speaker**: and it's decompressing

[02:38:20] **Speaker**: okay this is it going in at the top

[02:38:22] **Speaker**: coming out at the bottom remember the

[02:38:24] **Speaker**: gold the emanations this is what

[02:38:26] **Speaker**: everyone else lost and forget every

[02:38:28] **Speaker**: physicist every scientist every

[02:38:30] **Speaker**: mathematician didn't remember that right

[02:38:33] **Speaker**: there okay there's something driving

[02:38:36] **Speaker**: this thing and it's coming out of the

[02:38:37] **Speaker**: center it's a higher dimensional energy

[02:38:40] **Speaker**: the universe can be quantifying whole
numbers and number nine is a spindle 
[02:38:43] **Speaker**: around which everything revolves

[02:38:44] **Speaker**: diagonally in my goodness virals so

[02:38:47] **Speaker**: there's the number nine shooting out in

[02:38:49] **Speaker**: multiples of seven

[02:38:51] **Speaker**: a tornado is more powerful than a

[02:38:53] **Speaker**: nuclear bomb what devastated Kauai but

[02:38:56] **Speaker**: tornado according to the vortex now the

[02:38:59] **Speaker**: reason I did this is that a tornado is

[02:39:01] **Speaker**: based on the word Torah

[02:39:03] **Speaker**: okay and our bodies called a torso and

[02:39:06] **Speaker**: that's what we're modeling is a toilet

[02:39:08] **Speaker**: this is called a toroid coil okay and

[02:39:10] **Speaker**: this is called toroidal pinch where it

[02:39:12] **Speaker**: gets very small in the center Center is

[02:39:14] **Speaker**: a toroid now the universe they say

[02:39:17] **Speaker**: well they say a black hole disappears

[02:39:20] **Speaker**: into nothing but a black hole turns into

[02:39:22] **Speaker**: a white hole it decompresses out

[02:39:25] **Speaker**: okay here's the Earth's magnetosphere in

[02:39:28] **Speaker**: a Taurus okay these are all based on a

[02:39:31] **Speaker**: vortex

[02:39:32] **Speaker**: okay now

[02:39:35] **Speaker**: this is called a funnel are you having

[02:39:38] **Speaker**: fun

[02:39:39] **Speaker**: there's a dandelion cross principle how

[02:39:42] **Speaker**: the universary process itself because

[02:39:44] **Speaker**: I'm saying it's an ecological system it

[02:39:46] **Speaker**: comes out the nozzle the jet which is

[02:39:48] **Speaker**: right through here Nature's hourglass

[02:39:50] **Speaker**: and decompresses okay and these are

[02:39:53] **Speaker**: toradal field coils and decompresses and

[02:39:55] **Speaker**: purifies it and it comes out again all

[02:39:57] **Speaker**: over again to continue the process

[02:40:00] **Speaker**: okay time wrap this is for these are

[02:40:03] **Speaker**: just other things I put okay so let's

[02:40:06] **Speaker**: look at a toroid

[02:40:09] **Speaker**: um

[02:40:09] **Speaker**: I'm gonna ask you to be our new

[02:40:12] **Speaker**: assistant yes

[02:40:14] **Speaker**: would you please

[02:40:16] **Speaker**: spin that and make that into a vortex

[02:40:20] **Speaker**: is it no

[02:40:23] **Speaker**: um

[02:40:24] **Speaker**: I'm gonna ask you to be our new

[02:40:26] **Speaker**: assistant yes

[02:40:28] **Speaker**: would you please

[02:40:30] **Speaker**: spin that and make that into a large

[02:40:33] **Speaker**: vortex

[02:40:35] **Speaker**: no do you know how to do it

[02:40:38] **Speaker**: no he'll do it no

[02:40:41] **Speaker**: there you go can't get it going faster

[02:40:44] **Speaker**: faster faster faster okay

[02:40:48] **Speaker**: stop

[02:40:50] **Speaker**: you just start move your hand move it

[02:40:51] **Speaker**: only in the center

[02:40:53] **Speaker**: there you go there is your tornado there

[02:40:55] **Speaker**: is your Vortex it's compressing going

[02:40:58] **Speaker**: through the singularity where the energy

[02:41:00] **Speaker**: shoots out from and going out the White

[02:41:02] **Speaker**: Hall and I'll come back and go again in

[02:41:04] **Speaker**: a closed loop cycle that's ecological

[02:41:06] **Speaker**: and that's how the coil is made but it's

[02:41:09] **Speaker**: not made like this it's made almost

[02:41:12] **Speaker**: straight lines around the visible nine

[02:41:16] **Speaker**: that it's spinning around the vortex

[02:41:17] **Speaker**: yeah real fast

[02:41:20] **Speaker**: yeah no a lot of people sell machines

[02:41:23] **Speaker**: does that do that so there's

[02:41:32] **Speaker**: they say it puts back the life energy

[02:41:35] **Speaker**: into the water yeah

[02:41:42] **Speaker**: my friend Ray spins every morning

[02:41:46] **Speaker**: with those Fountain of you

[02:41:48] **Speaker**: next first one

[02:41:49] **Speaker**: thing more than 21 times

[02:41:52] **Speaker**: yeah a lot of Mystics like dervishes
that go into um 
[02:41:56] **Speaker**: what would be the state mystical States

[02:41:58] **Speaker**: uh

[02:42:00] **Speaker**: about the money and uh by the spinning

[02:42:03] **Speaker**: and stuff like that they go to into

[02:42:05] **Speaker**: ecstatic States they go into effects
ecst static station um that's interesting um 
[02:42:25] **Speaker**: all tied in the four to six all the

[02:42:27] **Speaker**: chakras the meridians all the holistic

[02:42:29] **Speaker**: medicine it's all tied in again to what

[02:42:31] **Speaker**: where's Brian when we need them

[02:42:34] **Speaker**: four to six

[02:42:36] **Speaker**: uh we mentioned Brian because he's a

[02:42:38] **Speaker**: naturopath who

[02:42:40] **Speaker**: was here an hour ago

[02:42:45] **Speaker**: who's home we're in okay

[02:42:49] **Speaker**: um
so 
[02:42:54] **Speaker**: I'm explaining a vortex

[02:42:56] **Speaker**: and how it works
now 
[02:43:01] **Speaker**: the vortex
is driven 
[02:43:07] **Speaker**: by the emanations coming out the center

[02:43:09] **Speaker**: you can see it clearly in the pulsing of

[02:43:11] **Speaker**: thirds one two three the thirds

[02:43:15] **Speaker**: intersect in a harmonica timing it's

[02:43:17] **Speaker**: like music

[02:43:18] **Speaker**: musical harmonics and that's how I keep

[02:43:21] **Speaker**: the electricity from having friction

[02:43:25] **Speaker**: and having random collisions

[02:43:30] **Speaker**: Charlie and Judy

[02:43:32] **Speaker**: guys are in deep space

[02:43:36] **Speaker**: I heard this oh so you remember it yeah
okay 
[02:43:46] **Speaker**: I think you're about to discover some
new things 
[02:43:56] **Speaker**: here's your three nice sixes in the

[02:43:59] **Speaker**: center right so your 396 is always in
the center remember I said we leave it 
[02:44:03] **Speaker**: alone

[02:44:03] **Speaker**: 396693 it flips versus 396 and remember

[02:44:07] **Speaker**: I said it flip 693

[02:44:09] **Speaker**: here's your one two four eight seven

[02:44:11] **Speaker**: fives going in

[02:44:13] **Speaker**: so this is one winding here's the other

[02:44:15] **Speaker**: one then going up one two four eight
seven five 
[02:44:21] **Speaker**: and if you put these both together

[02:44:23] **Speaker**: okay

[02:44:26] **Speaker**: you get this guy

[02:44:28] **Speaker**: which is the skin of the toroid because

[02:44:30] **Speaker**: here you have doubling down one two four

[02:44:32] **Speaker**: seven five here we have doubling up one

[02:44:34] **Speaker**: two four seven five there's your 3960.

[02:44:36] **Speaker**: okay this and those two ingredients

[02:44:39] **Speaker**: those two ingredients make this in fact

[02:44:42] **Speaker**: everything you're seeing is all one and

[02:44:43] **Speaker**: the same The Numbers Never Move I'm just

[02:44:45] **Speaker**: giving you zoom views cross-section

[02:44:47] **Speaker**: views I'm giving you out of surface

[02:44:50] **Speaker**: views

[02:44:52] **Speaker**: picture television screen is 500 25

[02:44:55] **Speaker**: lines right what's that five two five

[02:44:58] **Speaker**: that's called set adds to twelve that

[02:45:01] **Speaker**: makes three right 525 lines go down and

[02:45:05] **Speaker**: then it zooms up in a blank that uh

[02:45:10] **Speaker**: diagonal line and then it comes back

[02:45:12] **Speaker**: down again to fill in the other ones

[02:45:14] **Speaker**: that it did but that there's a blank

[02:45:16] **Speaker**: line in there why is that a blank line

[02:45:18] **Speaker**: in there oh that's a good point I'm

[02:45:20] **Speaker**: wearing line every time you're seeing

[02:45:22] **Speaker**: every second there's a blank line in

[02:45:24] **Speaker**: there yeah that's a good point that's

[02:45:26] **Speaker**: where they put all the sub uh the sub

[02:45:28] **Speaker**: stuff that they sent you that's what

[02:45:30] **Speaker**: they put all this so carrier yeah and

[02:45:33] **Speaker**: that's also where they put the um

[02:45:35] **Speaker**: why I think it's called for the um the

[02:45:37] **Speaker**: death it reads that that's where it's

[02:45:40] **Speaker**: that's where it is and it has to be

[02:45:41] **Speaker**: somewhere right or the visual characters

[02:45:49] **Speaker**: it comes to three it adds up to three

[02:45:52] **Speaker**: it's really interesting yeah well it's
really interesting too that you broke it 
[02:45:56] **Speaker**: down and then the interlacing because

[02:45:57] **Speaker**: really what I'm doing here is is

[02:46:00] **Speaker**: interlacing and really what I'm doing is

[02:46:02] **Speaker**: I'm creating a um because in reality all

[02:46:05] **Speaker**: the lines that exist are really the

[02:46:07] **Speaker**: diagonal lines this way it's all moving

[02:46:09] **Speaker**: this way it's the right hand rule and in

[02:46:11] **Speaker**: reality all these lines this way don't

[02:46:13] **Speaker**: exist but I needed to put them there so

[02:46:16] **Speaker**: I could show you that there is really a

[02:46:19] **Speaker**: tile or a spatial or a volume and how it

[02:46:22] **Speaker**: moved in reality all these other lines

[02:46:24] **Speaker**: under here don't exist what you're

[02:46:27] **Speaker**: seeing is really just this which is the

[02:46:30] **Speaker**: winding of the coil but what I did was I

[02:46:32] **Speaker**: certain posed I interlaced the inner

[02:46:34] **Speaker**: Carriage so then that you would have a

[02:46:36] **Speaker**: matrix from which you can tile from

[02:46:39] **Speaker**: which you then can can

[02:46:41] **Speaker**: decorate your environment so that you

[02:46:45] **Speaker**: can then navigate and move about to move

[02:46:48] **Speaker**: around in it because that's what this

[02:46:50] **Speaker**: whole thing is it's a navigational map

[02:46:52] **Speaker**: it tells you how you go anywhere in the

[02:46:54] **Speaker**: universe and up and down and know what's

[02:46:57] **Speaker**: going on the universe it's the secret of

[02:46:58] **Speaker**: gyroscope and it's a it's these numbers

[02:47:01] **Speaker**: this everything the number nine is the

[02:47:03] **Speaker**: source of the gyroscope and everything's

[02:47:05] **Speaker**: spinning around that

[02:47:07] **Speaker**: okay everybody ready

[02:47:09] **Speaker**: so I'll explain to you how it works now

[02:47:12] **Speaker**: remember we were going to say that it is

[02:47:14] **Speaker**: a

[02:47:15] **Speaker**: okay so you now see that this is the

[02:47:17] **Speaker**: skin so these Pilots really get bigger

[02:47:19] **Speaker**: and smaller see how they're longer here

[02:47:21] **Speaker**: and wider out here but here I I had to

[02:47:24] **Speaker**: make them just like a grid cloth to keep

[02:47:26] **Speaker**: it simple okay otherwise I could they

[02:47:29] **Speaker**: would have been getting bigger okay

[02:47:32] **Speaker**: by the way this cheesecloth is very

[02:47:34] **Speaker**: important again there's no horizontal or

[02:47:36] **Speaker**: vertical line it's all diagonals like

[02:47:38] **Speaker**: our symbol

[02:47:39] **Speaker**: um in that's why in relativity

[02:47:43] **Speaker**: everything's a warp and curve remember I

[02:47:45] **Speaker**: said time follows a logarithmic spiral

[02:47:47] **Speaker**: the dazzling circuit everything's

[02:47:48] **Speaker**: diagonal not time on our third dimension

[02:47:51] **Speaker**: not a bullet shooting not light nothing

[02:47:54] **Speaker**: can be horizontal or vertical perfectly

[02:47:56] **Speaker**: even a photon behind the eclipse of the

[02:47:59] **Speaker**: sun was seeing the Curve

[02:48:01] **Speaker**: uh Photon coming from a distant star

[02:48:03] **Speaker**: proving that relativity existed

[02:48:06] **Speaker**: okay so yeah

[02:48:09] **Speaker**: so here again

[02:48:11] **Speaker**: we are looking at F so when they do math

[02:48:13] **Speaker**: made out of horizontal vertical lines

[02:48:16] **Speaker**: you do get a quadril sheet of paper and

[02:48:18] **Speaker**: you calculate things that's totally

[02:48:19] **Speaker**: false because if you get a quad Rule and

[02:48:22] **Speaker**: you put it diagonally everything

[02:48:24] **Speaker**: diagonally it's not squares it's

[02:48:26] **Speaker**: diamonds

[02:48:27] **Speaker**: when everything's a diamond then you can

[02:48:29] **Speaker**: pick up your calculations you can go off

[02:48:31] **Speaker**: that end and you can go through a hole

[02:48:33] **Speaker**: and come back out the other end and you

[02:48:35] **Speaker**: can actually be the Toro does everyone

[02:48:37] **Speaker**: fall out

[02:48:39] **Speaker**: okay I'll show a picture of that too

[02:48:42] **Speaker**: everybody can say no I didn't follow it

[02:48:46] **Speaker**: but this is what it looks like this is

[02:48:48] **Speaker**: what I mean going through the hole

[02:48:51] **Speaker**: okay so on on diamonds you can go you

[02:48:55] **Speaker**: can go off the page this way and you're

[02:48:58] **Speaker**: really coming back in around and you're

[02:49:00] **Speaker**: coming back out the other end

[02:49:01] **Speaker**: are you making a virtual reality of all
this information so you can kind of get 
[02:49:05] **Speaker**: inside it

[02:49:06] **Speaker**: it's it's something you can do okay okay

[02:49:10] **Speaker**: we need someone to do this

[02:49:17] **Speaker**: no actually it needs to be modeled on a
computer because that way you can see 
[02:49:20] **Speaker**: when you start with the number how the

[02:49:21] **Speaker**: energy vibrates when you have a motion

[02:49:24] **Speaker**: here it goes over to there

[02:49:26] **Speaker**: you can have fun on that when we get to

[02:49:28] **Speaker**: that showing vibration and motion okay

[02:49:30] **Speaker**: so everything's spinning around the nine

[02:49:32] **Speaker**: why because the ethernet magnets is in

[02:49:34] **Speaker**: the invisible field is displacing

[02:49:35] **Speaker**: everything creating the vortex okay and
um 
[02:49:40] **Speaker**: you have the doubling circuits and they

[02:49:42] **Speaker**: come around contract

[02:49:44] **Speaker**: so I think we'll start right now on that

[02:49:46] **Speaker**: vibration that you'll have fun with and

[02:49:48] **Speaker**: that energy so let's see if I can find
it here it is right here okay 
[02:49:53] **Speaker**: we're gonna have to go backwards because

[02:49:55] **Speaker**: we lose 90 of the stuff is the charts

[02:49:58] **Speaker**: that we didn't cover oh that isn't there

[02:49:59] **Speaker**: that's mysticism

[02:50:02] **Speaker**: well you would have liked that anyway

[02:50:04] **Speaker**: that's dealing with the letters in the

[02:50:06] **Speaker**: name of God in harmonics and they all

[02:50:08] **Speaker**: have numbers

[02:50:10] **Speaker**: okay so far

[02:50:13] **Speaker**: yeah

[02:50:14] **Speaker**: you get to pick a number any number

[02:50:18] **Speaker**: five five

[02:50:21] **Speaker**: okay which five would you like

[02:50:30] **Speaker**: right here

[02:50:34] **Speaker**: way up there

[02:50:44] **Speaker**: how come you guys know that that was the

[02:50:46] **Speaker**: one you wanted and why would he pick

[02:50:48] **Speaker**: this one it's so hard

[02:50:51] **Speaker**: yeah I'm drying I actually shouldn't be

[02:50:54] **Speaker**: using glue should I oh

[02:50:56] **Speaker**: okay so we have

[02:50:59] **Speaker**: we have five percent okay so we we're
going to add up all the numbers and stop at six one and one is two two and two is 
[02:51:05] **Speaker**: four four and four is eight eight seven

[02:51:06] **Speaker**: is fifteen is six nine and eight nine
and six is six six and six is twelve is three six and three is nine nine five is 
[02:51:11] **Speaker**: fourteen one plus four I think it's five

[02:51:12] **Speaker**: that's what you get a hard one I did it

[02:51:15] **Speaker**: quick

[02:51:16] **Speaker**: okay do it again

[02:51:19] **Speaker**: okay can you do it with seven

[02:51:21] **Speaker**: okay we'll do it with seven one plus one

[02:51:24] **Speaker**: equals two two plus two equals four four

[02:51:28] **Speaker**: plus four equals eight eight plus seven

[02:51:31] **Speaker**: is fifteen which is six six and six is

[02:51:34] **Speaker**: twelve is three six and three is nine

[02:51:37] **Speaker**: um and they're right wrong one and one

[02:51:39] **Speaker**: is two two and two is four point four is

[02:51:41] **Speaker**: eight I need a caller you want to be the
column 
[02:51:49] **Speaker**: is two four four and four is eight eight

[02:51:54] **Speaker**: and seven is fifteen which is six six

[02:51:57] **Speaker**: and nine yeah it's fifteen
yeah 
[02:52:06] **Speaker**: three and six is nine

[02:52:10] **Speaker**: nine and five and fourteen which is five

[02:52:12] **Speaker**: so it's still equaling that little drop

[02:52:16] **Speaker**: that's shooting out

[02:52:17] **Speaker**: it's still being generated by that

[02:52:20] **Speaker**: little drop so we had to add all the

[02:52:22] **Speaker**: numbers yeah right that's why it's

[02:52:25] **Speaker**: called Point Energy creation physics

[02:52:27] **Speaker**: because there's a point coming out from

[02:52:29] **Speaker**: the inside of this choroid skin making

[02:52:32] **Speaker**: that

[02:52:34] **Speaker**: that happened

[02:52:36] **Speaker**: in other words there's a an emanation

[02:52:39] **Speaker**: shooting out that's making all these

[02:52:41] **Speaker**: numbers

[02:52:42] **Speaker**: Ripple does it relate to Zero Point

[02:52:45] **Speaker**: Energy this is Zero Point Energy Right

[02:52:49] **Speaker**: what

[02:52:51] **Speaker**: Christmas

[02:52:52] **Speaker**: are what looks like our skin yeah yeah

[02:52:55] **Speaker**: it is our skin actually does have that

[02:52:56] **Speaker**: everything has it even our bones when

[02:52:58] **Speaker**: they do x-rays it's imprinted everywhere

[02:53:00] **Speaker**: there's some charts in there that's

[02:53:01] **Speaker**: exactly right literally we can always

[02:53:03] **Speaker**: take this literally what we're working
on um 
[02:53:07] **Speaker**: so he asked does it relate to Zero Point
Energy okay so everyone's satisfied it makes a wave of nine 
[02:53:15] **Speaker**: okay

[02:53:16] **Speaker**: that's right and what's coming out of

[02:53:18] **Speaker**: the zero

[02:53:20] **Speaker**: the nine all the numbers

[02:53:22] **Speaker**: okay are created by this energy

[02:53:25] **Speaker**: so

[02:53:27] **Speaker**: one of your points is that if you take a

[02:53:30] **Speaker**: number and you add around it you end up

[02:53:32] **Speaker**: with nine always always

[02:53:34] **Speaker**: any number you get that number back

[02:53:37] **Speaker**: exactly

[02:53:39] **Speaker**: right and Zero Point Energy over Unity

[02:53:41] **Speaker**: free energy alternate energy this is

[02:53:43] **Speaker**: what we've discovered

[02:53:45] **Speaker**: because of the nine

[02:53:48] **Speaker**: right

[02:53:50] **Speaker**: do you mean if you ever known to the

[02:53:52] **Speaker**: center number

[02:53:54] **Speaker**: you get the number in the center yeah

[02:53:57] **Speaker**: but you'll get the numbers you'll get

[02:53:58] **Speaker**: the drop yeah but if you added nine to

[02:54:01] **Speaker**: seven you'd get seven okay

[02:54:03] **Speaker**: and they had nine two days you get in

[02:54:06] **Speaker**: okay so you get nine on the outside
whenever you go and then when you finally head into the middle number 
[02:54:11] **Speaker**: you'll get that little number again

[02:54:13] **Speaker**: let's pick seven

[02:54:15] **Speaker**: you pick seven correct over there

[02:54:19] **Speaker**: or essential essential Aroma oil what

[02:54:23] **Speaker**: you pick seven give me a seven

[02:54:26] **Speaker**: yeah

[02:54:27] **Speaker**: right which one

[02:54:30] **Speaker**: which one okay

[02:54:34] **Speaker**: we have seven

[02:54:36] **Speaker**: okay because she made one easy for me

[02:54:38] **Speaker**: I'm gonna make waves around it even
farther out 
[02:54:42] **Speaker**: okay

[02:54:44] **Speaker**: you can even go this far out God help us

[02:54:46] **Speaker**: that'll be not too easy be here all

[02:54:50] **Speaker**: night I'm going okay you see what we're

[02:54:53] **Speaker**: doing

[02:54:54] **Speaker**: okay I'll make seven

[02:54:57] **Speaker**: I'll make seven

[02:54:59] **Speaker**: so here's seven

[02:55:01] **Speaker**: okay who's gonna be the caller who's

[02:55:04] **Speaker**: really quick who's really fast enough to

[02:55:06] **Speaker**: this knife you can do it here he goes

[02:55:10] **Speaker**: okay
let's do 
[02:55:14] **Speaker**: two two

[02:55:15] **Speaker**: perfect eight

[02:55:19] **Speaker**: four

[02:55:20] **Speaker**: six

[02:55:23] **Speaker**: one

[02:55:25] **Speaker**: nine perfect

[02:55:28] **Speaker**: a wave of nine let's do another one so

[02:55:30] **Speaker**: it goes to nine and then comes back to

[02:55:32] **Speaker**: the seventh well we already did this and

[02:55:34] **Speaker**: it was seven so we really don't have to

[02:55:35] **Speaker**: even think about it okay

[02:55:40] **Speaker**: because we're really just looking at the

[02:55:42] **Speaker**: with this is the source which is the

[02:55:44] **Speaker**: seven so it's making waves in all

[02:55:46] **Speaker**: Direction but it doesn't want to lose
that seven it's been equal to like a four or something that would be seven 
[02:55:50] **Speaker**: fours eleven two wouldn't be a seven

[02:55:52] **Speaker**: anymore that's right one is the one that

[02:55:54] **Speaker**: stays constant uh in the middle of the

[02:55:57] **Speaker**: vortex exactly

[02:56:00] **Speaker**: and if you go out further right

[02:56:02] **Speaker**: it works too he will tell us

[02:56:06] **Speaker**: that's why in in a tornado it will like

[02:56:09] **Speaker**: shoot out stuff and it'll still be

[02:56:11] **Speaker**: perfect in a hole and everything else

[02:56:14] **Speaker**: around it will be destroyed except for

[02:56:16] **Speaker**: what was in the actual center right

[02:56:18] **Speaker**: oh yeah

[02:56:26] **Speaker**: seven plus four two
five 
[02:56:31] **Speaker**: or

[02:56:33] **Speaker**: a
one 
[02:56:36] **Speaker**: two

[02:56:38] **Speaker**: seven
four 
[02:56:41] **Speaker**: five
six 
[02:56:45] **Speaker**: three

[02:56:47] **Speaker**: three

[02:56:49] **Speaker**: six nine

[02:56:53] **Speaker**: amen

[02:56:55] **Speaker**: I like that concentration another nine

[02:57:02] **Speaker**: okay

[02:57:04] **Speaker**: but you can always what you're adding uh

[02:57:07] **Speaker**: yeah especium or algae

[02:57:10] **Speaker**: what's my numerology

[02:57:13] **Speaker**: what do you mean what number your name I
don't do it based on the sequence of 
[02:57:18] **Speaker**: numerology I don't use man-made

[02:57:19] **Speaker**: numerology I use scriptural numerology

[02:57:22] **Speaker**: which I will go into that was actually

[02:57:24] **Speaker**: the board I pulled up based on an Arabic

[02:57:26] **Speaker**: language or the Persian or the Sanskrit

[02:57:28] **Speaker**: or the scriptural not man-made

[02:57:37] **Speaker**: he asked me what number my name added up

[02:57:40] **Speaker**: to

[02:57:41] **Speaker**: and I said I I my name does have a value

[02:57:44] **Speaker**: but I said I don't use the numerology

[02:57:46] **Speaker**: based on English where we arbitrarily

[02:57:48] **Speaker**: say a is one B is 2 C is three I say I

[02:57:52] **Speaker**: use a different kind of numerology not

[02:57:53] **Speaker**: based on Superstition or witchcraft or

[02:57:55] **Speaker**: Voodoo the kind of numerology I use is

[02:57:58] **Speaker**: what I call Quantum numerology and where

[02:58:01] **Speaker**: I learned that was studying on the name

[02:58:03] **Speaker**: of God out of the different religions
out of the script different scriptures 
[02:58:06] **Speaker**: because the name of God was always

[02:58:07] **Speaker**: sacred and so holy and all the major

[02:58:09] **Speaker**: religions recorded all their knowledges

[02:58:12] **Speaker**: not with math but with their alphabet

[02:58:15] **Speaker**: with their letters okay I'll show you an
example of that 
[02:58:21] **Speaker**: here's the Arabic alphabet

[02:58:24] **Speaker**: here is

[02:58:26] **Speaker**: the mathematical correspondent for T is

[02:58:30] **Speaker**: not for Z is 900 for DOT I can't even

[02:58:34] **Speaker**: angle oh that's the key letter right

[02:58:36] **Speaker**: there

[02:58:37] **Speaker**: um is represented by that symbol there

[02:58:40] **Speaker**: we don't even have it in English it's

[02:58:41] **Speaker**: seven it's smaller than the name is the

[02:58:44] **Speaker**: Hamza and that's actually the word of

[02:58:46] **Speaker**: God and that's actually the sound that

[02:58:48] **Speaker**: the God will stop and that's actually

[02:58:49] **Speaker**: the word that we're talking about that

[02:58:51] **Speaker**: creative creation stuff like that

[02:58:54] **Speaker**: um but that's religious mistresses

[02:58:56] **Speaker**: and and we're not we're not ready for

[02:59:00] **Speaker**: that yet

[02:59:01] **Speaker**: but that's the numerical system that I

[02:59:03] **Speaker**: used that I found this toroid skin

[02:59:05] **Speaker**: okay so we'll come back to the stuff

[02:59:08] **Speaker**: dealing with math

[02:59:09] **Speaker**: okay

[02:59:11] **Speaker**: math and letters and harmonics and

[02:59:13] **Speaker**: sounds eventually where that will take

[02:59:14] **Speaker**: that we'll take it to the brain in our

[02:59:16] **Speaker**: intelligence and brain waves and the

[02:59:18] **Speaker**: cephalograms and meditation and worship

[02:59:21] **Speaker**: the Mantra and how to tap into remaining

[02:59:23] **Speaker**: potential of the brain has happened to

[02:59:25] **Speaker**: 90 potential unused part of the brain

[02:59:27] **Speaker**: and essentially how to become Geniuses

[02:59:30] **Speaker**: and psychic States and be able to do

[02:59:32] **Speaker**: Miracles and all that other stuff that

[02:59:34] **Speaker**: is inherently latent potential within us

[02:59:35] **Speaker**: that we should already be doing that

[02:59:37] **Speaker**: we've never fully realized yet yeah are

[02:59:41] **Speaker**: you going to go into how
um 
[02:59:48] **Speaker**: magic attack I think so I think you
should know that in other words you want 
[02:59:53] **Speaker**: to know how these numbers make the coil

[02:59:54] **Speaker**: well well I see that one two four eight

[02:59:57] **Speaker**: seven five since you started a blue one

[02:59:59] **Speaker**: just anyone

[03:00:00] **Speaker**: start a blue one blue one one two four

[03:00:02] **Speaker**: eight seven five one two four seven five

[03:00:05] **Speaker**: all right that's your sequence if you go

[03:00:07] **Speaker**: next door to it no the other way not

[03:00:09] **Speaker**: right next to it the one the red one
right under there we go if you go 
[03:00:12] **Speaker**: backwards you're going in the negative

[03:00:13] **Speaker**: breath but that's not the one that

[03:00:16] **Speaker**: matches that polar opposite this is but

[03:00:17] **Speaker**: this is the pair see they're in a pair

[03:00:19] **Speaker**: see the dark black line is this

[03:00:23] **Speaker**: exactly

[03:00:26] **Speaker**: exactly oh okay okay

[03:00:29] **Speaker**: these are your pair in here this is your
binary triplets 
[03:00:36] **Speaker**: like this also the one next time

[03:00:40] **Speaker**: in an opposite direction I mean if you

[03:00:43] **Speaker**: were just a constructive without any

[03:00:45] **Speaker**: theoretical considerations if you just
said I need to remember how to construct this 
[03:00:50] **Speaker**: see couldn't you just take that say that
blue walk you start with that blue one 
[03:00:53] **Speaker**: not after the one that you started with
before 
[03:00:59] **Speaker**: one two four eight seven five going up

[03:01:02] **Speaker**: right okay

[03:01:04] **Speaker**: and if you started sort of the red one

[03:01:07] **Speaker**: diagonally to the right now and you went

[03:01:10] **Speaker**: one two four eight six seven so you get

[03:01:12] **Speaker**: the same numbers right the pattern if

[03:01:14] **Speaker**: you go one two four eight seven five

[03:01:16] **Speaker**: only backwards right okay Charlene

[03:01:20] **Speaker**: and your point is

[03:01:24] **Speaker**: um I'm just asking you I was asking if

[03:01:26] **Speaker**: you would care if you did you did not

[03:01:28] **Speaker**: intend to construct it that way and I
don't know if it works out throughout 
[03:01:32] **Speaker**: the chart that way

[03:01:34] **Speaker**: but that's what I'm seeing right now in
other words they're moving in opposite 
[03:01:38] **Speaker**: directions but it's the same numbers

[03:01:39] **Speaker**: except separated by the the mirror

[03:01:45] **Speaker**: 693-396-693-396. over and over again

[03:01:47] **Speaker**: always right the same pattern no matter

[03:01:49] **Speaker**: what that's right

[03:01:55] **Speaker**: here's what we're looking at right this

[03:01:57] **Speaker**: is our lattice our Matrix

[03:02:02] **Speaker**: okay

[03:02:03] **Speaker**: I'll show you when yes you can make it

[03:02:06] **Speaker**: if you just know in fact there's just no

[03:02:07] **Speaker**: three numbers you know everything

[03:02:09] **Speaker**: okay here's your um one two four eight

[03:02:13] **Speaker**: seven five that's the pattern that you

[03:02:14] **Speaker**: saw okay

[03:02:17] **Speaker**: um

[03:02:18] **Speaker**: and then you said you'd make a red one

[03:02:20] **Speaker**: right next up you have to make it red

[03:02:22] **Speaker**: though well then you go one two the two

[03:02:25] **Speaker**: would be uh okay but watch this so we

[03:02:28] **Speaker**: know it's so right here we had a

[03:02:31] **Speaker**: a five a seven an eight four two

[03:02:36] **Speaker**: um a one a five and that's how we make

[03:02:38] **Speaker**: it huh okay watch this so this is for

[03:02:42] **Speaker**: everyone to understand you want to make

[03:02:44] **Speaker**: it by just knowing that pattern right

[03:02:46] **Speaker**: every single axis remember our 3D that's

[03:02:49] **Speaker**: underneath here that I just erased our
3D coordinate system 
[03:02:53] **Speaker**: um

[03:02:54] **Speaker**: which is um the toroid right here which

[03:02:57] **Speaker**: is explained in this bar remember I said

[03:02:59] **Speaker**: the multiplication table remember I said

[03:03:01] **Speaker**: it was XYZ

[03:03:02] **Speaker**: here's our eight ones this way here's

[03:03:04] **Speaker**: our four and five is this way okay let

[03:03:06] **Speaker**: me show you what I mean I can make this

[03:03:08] **Speaker**: whole thing

[03:03:11] **Speaker**: by just knowing that by looking at um

[03:03:17] **Speaker**: set um

[03:03:20] **Speaker**: YouTube for example except the one we

[03:03:24] **Speaker**: actually did it backwards

[03:03:26] **Speaker**: might he'll do it right
do this right 
[03:03:35] **Speaker**: okay and this has been one

[03:03:38] **Speaker**: two

[03:03:39] **Speaker**: four this is a one five seven eight four

[03:03:44] **Speaker**: two one we had them going reverse

[03:03:46] **Speaker**: Direction didn't we yeah okay so sure

[03:03:50] **Speaker**: enough

[03:03:52] **Speaker**: anywhere you go it will have to mean

[03:03:54] **Speaker**: something so we're going to look for the

[03:03:56] **Speaker**: nine okay we have the nine goes right

[03:03:59] **Speaker**: here and from any direction the nine
it's going to make the toroid scale why 
[03:04:03] **Speaker**: did you choose the nine right there

[03:04:04] **Speaker**: because the nines are that's because I

[03:04:06] **Speaker**: knew if you had two numbers here of

[03:04:08] **Speaker**: seven eight the next number after it

[03:04:09] **Speaker**: must be nine oh I see this must be a one

[03:04:11] **Speaker**: and this must be a two and this must be

[03:04:14] **Speaker**: a six then and this must be a five so I

[03:04:17] **Speaker**: got units of one four five

[03:04:19] **Speaker**: okay six seven eight okay okay but let's

[03:04:25] **Speaker**: go the opposite direction let's say I

[03:04:27] **Speaker**: just have a nine here I have a five here

[03:04:28] **Speaker**: I have a one here what must be over here

[03:04:31] **Speaker**: uh six perfect okay or let's say I have

[03:04:35] **Speaker**: a four here I have an eight here what

[03:04:37] **Speaker**: must be over here okay exactly right

[03:04:39] **Speaker**: okay and uh so not only can we figure

[03:04:43] **Speaker**: that this must be a nine right here

[03:04:44] **Speaker**: because it's two one nine but we also
know that it would be three eight four 
[03:04:48] **Speaker**: nine

[03:04:49] **Speaker**: okay because your eight and four is

[03:04:52] **Speaker**: three because five plus three is eight

[03:04:55] **Speaker**: eight plus five okay is thirteen is four

[03:04:58] **Speaker**: and four plus five is nine right okay or

[03:05:00] **Speaker**: we could have figured it that was a nine

[03:05:02] **Speaker**: right here because of the fact that here

[03:05:05] **Speaker**: we have a seven eight nine and if we've

[03:05:08] **Speaker**: gone six nine if we have a nine we know
on the opposite side of the knife one 
[03:05:11] **Speaker**: side's a six unless that'd be a three on

[03:05:13] **Speaker**: the other side so we had six nine three

[03:05:15] **Speaker**: and then three nine so again it would

[03:05:17] **Speaker**: have been a nine yeah so any way we

[03:05:19] **Speaker**: approach it we always know what the
number is going to be okay 
[03:05:25] **Speaker**: right

[03:05:26] **Speaker**: everything all right

[03:05:28] **Speaker**: okay it's across the world six nine

[03:05:32] **Speaker**: three three three nine six six nine

[03:05:35] **Speaker**: three and this would have been three

[03:05:36] **Speaker**: nine six six nine three and we would

[03:05:38] **Speaker**: have had nine eight seven six five

[03:05:43] **Speaker**: four and now we got this pattern again

[03:05:46] **Speaker**: so it's six nine three three nine six

[03:05:49] **Speaker**: and we got seven five one two four eight

[03:05:52] **Speaker**: and we can go two three four five six we

[03:05:56] **Speaker**: can actually count all the way over to

[03:05:57] **Speaker**: here two one nine eight seven six and

[03:06:01] **Speaker**: now we got two three four five six so

[03:06:06] **Speaker**: now we can go diagonally we got eight

[03:06:08] **Speaker**: four two one five seven

[03:06:11] **Speaker**: or we could have gone um
is that right 
[03:06:17] **Speaker**: um five one six

[03:06:20] **Speaker**: let's just fill them all in yeah one two

[03:06:22] **Speaker**: four eight seven so we got or we can go

[03:06:25] **Speaker**: this way four eight three

[03:06:29] **Speaker**: four eight seven five seven eight six

[03:06:32] **Speaker**: and no can't be three sixes in a row

[03:06:34] **Speaker**: it's eight seven six four five six seven

[03:06:37] **Speaker**: eight isn't it

[03:06:42] **Speaker**: no there's no less forms

[03:06:46] **Speaker**: look at it

[03:06:48] **Speaker**: okay I'm gonna I'm gonna have a door

[03:06:50] **Speaker**: Checker here frisky for force

[03:06:56] **Speaker**: is so you know how you do like card by

[03:06:59] **Speaker**: numbers you could just put a car for

[03:07:01] **Speaker**: each of those numbers yeah that's where

[03:07:03] **Speaker**: programming for computers and animation

[03:07:05] **Speaker**: because they're going to be a lot easier

[03:07:06] **Speaker**: in the eyes too well but there's another

[03:07:09] **Speaker**: reason why I didn't so you see it on

[03:07:10] **Speaker**: that yes Charlie any two diagonals add

[03:07:13] **Speaker**: up to either seven or two now I don't

[03:07:15] **Speaker**: know the significance of that nine seven

[03:07:16] **Speaker**: or sixteen one and seven if you start

[03:07:18] **Speaker**: with anything all of those mean two

[03:07:20] **Speaker**: seven two seven two seven that's a new

[03:07:22] **Speaker**: polarity no it's not even that's your

[03:07:24] **Speaker**: z-axis that's the invisible nine there's

[03:07:27] **Speaker**: multiples of seven coming out yeah but

[03:07:29] **Speaker**: they're all but five and four are

[03:07:31] **Speaker**: multiples of nine that's a different

[03:07:33] **Speaker**: answer so you don't get any um five four

[03:07:37] **Speaker**: or five but you see here's the trick

[03:07:38] **Speaker**: Charlie and everybody and it's not a

[03:07:40] **Speaker**: trick this is why it's so important now

[03:07:42] **Speaker**: is your center right now our vertical

[03:07:44] **Speaker**: axis around it is your eight and one

[03:07:46] **Speaker**: they're the first numbers around the

[03:07:47] **Speaker**: nine vertically so you can see them

[03:07:50] **Speaker**: vertically because you can see the

[03:07:52] **Speaker**: toroid skin vertically it's not hard

[03:07:57] **Speaker**: um what an a is a vertical axis around

[03:08:01] **Speaker**: thank you

[03:08:07] **Speaker**: so you can see the vertical axis of the

[03:08:10] **Speaker**: toroid

[03:08:11] **Speaker**: okay that it's nine eight seven six uh

[03:08:16] **Speaker**: five four so you got nine one two three

[03:08:20] **Speaker**: four five because the first number

[03:08:22] **Speaker**: around nine okay one two three four five

[03:08:26] **Speaker**: six and eight so nine

[03:08:29] **Speaker**: so one and eight is your vertical axis

[03:08:32] **Speaker**: the reason that you you don't you can

[03:08:34] **Speaker**: see them is because of your vertical

[03:08:36] **Speaker**: axis and you can see the five and four

[03:08:38] **Speaker**: okay because they're your vertical axis

[03:08:40] **Speaker**: okay which is four eight twelve okay

[03:08:43] **Speaker**: sixteen

[03:08:46] **Speaker**: um what is four times five is twenty

[03:08:47] **Speaker**: twenty four six okay or multiples of

[03:08:51] **Speaker**: five five ten fifteen twenty twenty five

[03:08:53] **Speaker**: thirty thirty five forty remember it was

[03:08:56] **Speaker**: a double coordinate system the blue is

[03:08:58] **Speaker**: all negative numbers the red is all

[03:08:59] **Speaker**: positive numbers that gives you your

[03:09:01] **Speaker**: diagonal which is how time moves How the

[03:09:03] **Speaker**: Universe moves of positive positive

[03:09:05] **Speaker**: negative positive negative positive

[03:09:08] **Speaker**: negative but it's based on a very

[03:09:10] **Speaker**: sophisticated system okay of um

[03:09:14] **Speaker**: a positive and negative really being two

[03:09:17] **Speaker**: coordinate systems one here one and

[03:09:19] **Speaker**: eights and five and uh one's your one

[03:09:22] **Speaker**: four sevens being yellow and your blacks

[03:09:25] **Speaker**: is your two eight fives being black

[03:09:27] **Speaker**: overlapped Charlie together this is a

[03:09:30] **Speaker**: double coordinate system

[03:09:32] **Speaker**: which is then how you get to the size

[03:09:35] **Speaker**: negative positive negative positive

[03:09:38] **Speaker**: through the sides negative positive
okay 
[03:09:43] **Speaker**: um

[03:09:44] **Speaker**: and that's what these colors represent

[03:09:47] **Speaker**: okay

[03:09:49] **Speaker**: okay so go ahead

[03:09:52] **Speaker**: we're done this and not put the benign

[03:09:58] **Speaker**: because if they're really invisible

[03:09:59] **Speaker**: maybe we should make them invisible on

[03:10:01] **Speaker**: the graph just to see what it would show

[03:10:03] **Speaker**: me it's more complicated tell you

[03:10:06] **Speaker**: something
Korean 
[03:10:10] **Speaker**: yes I do know what you mean and yes it

[03:10:12] **Speaker**: should be done and everything

[03:10:15] **Speaker**: um but actually if you're going to omit

[03:10:17] **Speaker**: the noise or make them invisible

[03:10:19] **Speaker**: actually I'd spend a lot of time doing

[03:10:21] **Speaker**: what you're saying but I use it for

[03:10:22] **Speaker**: modeling the energy like the spirit and

[03:10:24] **Speaker**: you take the spirit away from matter you

[03:10:26] **Speaker**: don't have matter but but what I'm

[03:10:28] **Speaker**: saying yeah

[03:10:30] **Speaker**: but I do it in another sense I I leave

[03:10:32] **Speaker**: in the red nights I take out the blue

[03:10:33] **Speaker**: lines which are negative and I show the

[03:10:35] **Speaker**: negative graph drop counter space so all

[03:10:37] **Speaker**: this really is about all these

[03:10:39] **Speaker**: approaches all these directions doing

[03:10:41] **Speaker**: all this stuff is connected modeling

[03:10:46] **Speaker**: okay so what did I just do here

[03:10:50] **Speaker**: this is the coil okay now the first

[03:10:54] **Speaker**: strand is it comes around and comes

[03:10:56] **Speaker**: around back again

[03:10:58] **Speaker**: this tile right here let's look at this

[03:11:01] **Speaker**: tile I'm gonna Circle the one two four

[03:11:04] **Speaker**: this one right here see it okay this

[03:11:08] **Speaker**: tile does not occur again on the same

[03:11:10] **Speaker**: axis

[03:11:12] **Speaker**: it's not easy I want to just follow this
line 
[03:11:19] **Speaker**: where is it it's this one over here

[03:11:21] **Speaker**: looks it

[03:11:23] **Speaker**: so all the way over here which should be

[03:11:25] **Speaker**: three over three of the binary triplets

[03:11:28] **Speaker**: so sure enough one

[03:11:30] **Speaker**: two three do you see that okay what that

[03:11:35] **Speaker**: means is that I can't just keep on

[03:11:38] **Speaker**: winding this wire like this that means

[03:11:41] **Speaker**: it has to go around in the star shapes

[03:11:44] **Speaker**: inspires before it comes around here and

[03:11:46] **Speaker**: so otherwise windings have to fill in in

[03:11:49] **Speaker**: between that means there has to be a

[03:11:50] **Speaker**: space in between this one and this one

[03:11:53] **Speaker**: and that's why this coil is wound in the

[03:11:56] **Speaker**: shape remember I had in between one and
two 
[03:12:00] **Speaker**: look at all the numbers I got in between

[03:12:02] **Speaker**: them

[03:12:04] **Speaker**: see one two three four okay four went

[03:12:08] **Speaker**: around from here one to four which is

[03:12:10] **Speaker**: the next time around remember this time

[03:12:12] **Speaker**: around the next time of the round it's

[03:12:13] **Speaker**: all the way over to here

[03:12:15] **Speaker**: and the ghetto but to get from one to

[03:12:18] **Speaker**: four to have these two in between how

[03:12:19] **Speaker**: many I have in between it one two so in

[03:12:23] **Speaker**: between one and four six and eleven

[03:12:24] **Speaker**: which gives me one two three the family

[03:12:27] **Speaker**: number group is the numbers isn't really

[03:12:29] **Speaker**: what's mattering the feminine on the

[03:12:31] **Speaker**: group is that it's showing that

[03:12:33] **Speaker**: everything is separated by thirds

[03:12:34] **Speaker**: doesn't matter that a four is a four a

[03:12:36] **Speaker**: one and one is there a Seven and Seven

[03:12:37] **Speaker**: it's saying nothing more than everything

[03:12:39] **Speaker**: has a phasing or an energy a positioning

[03:12:42] **Speaker**: of thirds based on stars and spiral and

[03:12:46] **Speaker**: stars and uh spirals

[03:12:50] **Speaker**: because this emanation is has a

[03:12:55] **Speaker**: a sequence or a phase in the firing rate

[03:12:57] **Speaker**: an activation sequence real complicated

[03:12:59] **Speaker**: stuff there's nothing more harder than

[03:13:00] **Speaker**: what I just told you okay

[03:13:03] **Speaker**: but as long as we're honest and I never

[03:13:05] **Speaker**: get the opportunity to talk about it

[03:13:07] **Speaker**: I think I'll go to to my my most hardest

[03:13:10] **Speaker**: sport you have to ask you one more

[03:13:12] **Speaker**: question sure

[03:13:13] **Speaker**: you said that two and seven is the Z

[03:13:15] **Speaker**: axis is that right correct okay actually

[03:13:19] **Speaker**: that's the only v-axis ever right no no

[03:13:23] **Speaker**: it gets more complicated but two and

[03:13:27] **Speaker**: seven is fundamentally distinct from the

[03:13:29] **Speaker**: 1 8 and the five four

[03:13:32] **Speaker**: in other words you know as an axis yeah

[03:13:35] **Speaker**: no let me just answer your question

[03:13:37] **Speaker**: without it being posed and you tell me

[03:13:39] **Speaker**: where you're driving at okay I'm not

[03:13:41] **Speaker**: sure but um what is happening is is

[03:13:45] **Speaker**: um remember I did a chart with three

[03:13:47] **Speaker**: different controls you still only have

[03:13:49] **Speaker**: one two four eight seven five you only

[03:13:51] **Speaker**: have the three polar pairs of eight and

[03:13:53] **Speaker**: one

[03:13:54] **Speaker**: uh seven and two and five and four but

[03:13:58] **Speaker**: in this system you also have because

[03:14:00] **Speaker**: everything's a threes you also can do a

[03:14:03] **Speaker**: um what we call a activation

[03:14:08] **Speaker**: moment of activation it's called a a

[03:14:13] **Speaker**: stage activation stage

[03:14:16] **Speaker**: and in each one of those polar pairs can

[03:14:19] **Speaker**: rotate to another axis

[03:14:22] **Speaker**: okay what counts is it can only be those

[03:14:26] **Speaker**: solar pairs polar pairs they're only

[03:14:27] **Speaker**: separated by Third and you're changing
from one axis to another and they actually have a sequence order of how 
[03:14:32] **Speaker**: they change and I believe that happens

[03:14:34] **Speaker**: on if I ever did computer modeling I

[03:14:36] **Speaker**: would show it as you have more layers

[03:14:38] **Speaker**: each layer would be a different family

[03:14:40] **Speaker**: would be another polar pair do you call

[03:14:42] **Speaker**: what I'm saying I think I think yeah

[03:14:43] **Speaker**: okay in other words

[03:14:46] **Speaker**: it's a lot more complicated than even

[03:14:49] **Speaker**: we've begun to discuss but but your

[03:14:52] **Speaker**: mind's contemplating all that stuff

[03:14:54] **Speaker**: already we've all contemplated real

[03:14:56] **Speaker**: contempl complicated stuff you were very

[03:14:59] **Speaker**: complicated you're very complicated

[03:15:01] **Speaker**: everyone's been real complicated okay

[03:15:04] **Speaker**: and but you know this is your first
class 
[03:15:09] **Speaker**: so but now that stuff is real it will

[03:15:11] **Speaker**: transpire it does happen what is this

[03:15:13] **Speaker**: math where they could be said it's

[03:15:15] **Speaker**: number permutations and what are we

[03:15:17] **Speaker**: looking at we're looking at the toroid

[03:15:19] **Speaker**: which is the ultimate shape for number

[03:15:21] **Speaker**: transformation for energy transformation

[03:15:23] **Speaker**: that's why you bought your blood cells

[03:15:25] **Speaker**: are a toroid this is why everything's

[03:15:26] **Speaker**: based on a toroid okay

[03:15:29] **Speaker**: um

[03:15:30] **Speaker**: so thus that means that you can work on

[03:15:34] **Speaker**: your own

[03:15:35] **Speaker**: transmutations permeations

[03:15:38] **Speaker**: okay that's what this math is about

[03:15:41] **Speaker**: explaining it's how the elements become

[03:15:43] **Speaker**: other elements and how time moves and

[03:15:45] **Speaker**: how cosmology is beginning as creative

[03:15:48] **Speaker**: what I learned from understanding this

[03:15:49] **Speaker**: is lots of stuff okay

[03:15:52] **Speaker**: let's let's keep me on what I'm supposed

[03:15:55] **Speaker**: to do

[03:15:57] **Speaker**: we we now know this coil is wound in a

[03:16:00] **Speaker**: certain way

[03:16:01] **Speaker**: okay but

[03:16:03] **Speaker**: what keeps this coil together I found

[03:16:06] **Speaker**: that the emanations shoot out in a

[03:16:08] **Speaker**: spiral that's even going over this whole

[03:16:10] **Speaker**: thing that's even bigger there's spirals

[03:16:12] **Speaker**: over spirals here's the dazzling

[03:16:14] **Speaker**: circuits we were out used to okay but

[03:16:19] **Speaker**: here we have

[03:16:22] **Speaker**: it's really a beautiful chart

[03:16:24] **Speaker**: first of all we see it's going one nine

[03:16:28] **Speaker**: one two going in here it's going eight

[03:16:31] **Speaker**: nine one in the reverse Direction it's
going out 
[03:16:36] **Speaker**: um

[03:16:37] **Speaker**: let's see two three four five the pink

[03:16:41] **Speaker**: ones are swirling outwards so they're

[03:16:44] **Speaker**: decompressing as the yellow ones swirl

[03:16:47] **Speaker**: inwards compress these are nested

[03:16:50] **Speaker**: vortices over the surface of the toroid

[03:16:52] **Speaker**: like dimples on a golf ball by their

[03:16:55] **Speaker**: existence they get rid of

[03:16:57] **Speaker**: crash it cannot even tilt there is no

[03:17:02] **Speaker**: tilt in this toroid they cannot tilt

[03:17:05] **Speaker**: because they're in quadrature when this

[03:17:07] **Speaker**: two and this two and this two and this

[03:17:09] **Speaker**: family number groups activated and the

[03:17:10] **Speaker**: other eight and five at the same time in

[03:17:12] **Speaker**: our group the other seven one fours are

[03:17:14] **Speaker**: activated and they're all breathing in

[03:17:16] **Speaker**: and out in such a way like dimples on a

[03:17:18] **Speaker**: golf ball or like

[03:17:20] **Speaker**: I wish I had a better pitcher but

[03:17:23] **Speaker**: they're all focused on the center these

[03:17:26] **Speaker**: nested vortices

[03:17:28] **Speaker**: um

[03:17:29] **Speaker**: in fact I do have a good photo picture

[03:17:32] **Speaker**: of it nested vortices focused on the

[03:17:34] **Speaker**: center look just like this

[03:17:39] **Speaker**: okay their vortices focused in the

[03:17:41] **Speaker**: center some spiral in and some spiral

[03:17:45] **Speaker**: out the ones that go in are called a

[03:17:47] **Speaker**: negative Vortex or a black hole the ones

[03:17:49] **Speaker**: that spiral out are called a white hole

[03:17:51] **Speaker**: or positive vortex

[03:17:54] **Speaker**: okay

[03:17:55] **Speaker**: and I figured out how the timing is how

[03:17:58] **Speaker**: to harness these vortices these nested

[03:18:01] **Speaker**: vortices they're very important

[03:18:02] **Speaker**: superconductivity and that's why I spoke

[03:18:05] **Speaker**: through airspace America that's one of
the most advanced flying machine in the world 
[03:18:10] **Speaker**: okay that's why I can get rid of

[03:18:11] **Speaker**: patrolling because I know the secret I

[03:18:14] **Speaker**: don't even need an airplane with wings

[03:18:16] **Speaker**: okay

[03:18:17] **Speaker**: um staggered calling message vortices

[03:18:19] **Speaker**: have the strongest cooking intrinsic

[03:18:21] **Speaker**: strength strength

[03:18:23] **Speaker**: and this is just the opposite of DNA so

[03:18:26] **Speaker**: when I go to DNA you'll see just the

[03:18:28] **Speaker**: reverse of this so real interesting how

[03:18:30] **Speaker**: this and DNA are connected because DNA

[03:18:33] **Speaker**: uses the nested vortices in mitosis to

[03:18:35] **Speaker**: do the sister strand unraveling

[03:18:40] **Speaker**: find it

[03:18:46] **Speaker**: you know somewhere
hmm 
[03:19:22] **Speaker**: well

[03:19:23] **Speaker**: let's see

[03:20:02] **Speaker**: oh well I'm gonna give up looking for it
for the minute 
[03:20:09] **Speaker**: you know where it is

[03:20:11] **Speaker**: what anybody care to guess and tell me

[03:20:14] **Speaker**: where the DNA chart is

[03:20:17] **Speaker**: yes thank you very much
thank you right 
[03:20:29] **Speaker**: here's your double spiral Helix here's

[03:20:32] **Speaker**: our symbol whenever our doubling

[03:20:35] **Speaker**: circuits are devil remember the space

[03:20:37] **Speaker**: for the 396 and with microbiology that's

[03:20:40] **Speaker**: called your major group

[03:20:43] **Speaker**: would you believe that DNA has that 396

[03:20:46] **Speaker**: that plus two that DNA is bounded by an

[03:20:48] **Speaker**: invisible field and that that is the

[03:20:52] **Speaker**: source of our genetic coding that

[03:20:54] **Speaker**: determines our Evolution that it isn't

[03:20:56] **Speaker**: round of trial and error or haphazard

[03:20:58] **Speaker**: chance yeah

[03:21:04] **Speaker**: let your pinkies make it smaller

[03:21:09] **Speaker**: yeah

[03:21:10] **Speaker**: so um symbol of Enlightenment that's

[03:21:13] **Speaker**: what I call that simple one

[03:21:15] **Speaker**: and sure enough it make you can actually

[03:21:16] **Speaker**: see it if you look I'm not going to

[03:21:18] **Speaker**: suddenly thieve off yeah

[03:21:22] **Speaker**: but your pinkies make it smaller

[03:21:26] **Speaker**: okay

[03:21:27] **Speaker**: so um this is a symbol of Enlightenment

[03:21:30] **Speaker**: that's what I call that simple and sure

[03:21:33] **Speaker**: enough it make you can actually see it

[03:21:34] **Speaker**: if you look inside DNA you can actually

[03:21:36] **Speaker**: see the shape of one two

[03:21:38] **Speaker**: three four five six seven eight nine oh

[03:21:42] **Speaker**: my God isn't that trippy

[03:21:55] **Speaker**: no no one's cracked the genetic code

[03:21:58] **Speaker**: they are are

[03:22:00] **Speaker**: showing the

[03:22:03] **Speaker**: connections of the amino acids the

[03:22:06] **Speaker**: phosphates their sequence order they

[03:22:08] **Speaker**: know nothing at the code if they knew of

[03:22:10] **Speaker**: the code then they would be able or they

[03:22:13] **Speaker**: cannot manipulate the code are they all

[03:22:15] **Speaker**: they're doing right now is like when we

[03:22:17] **Speaker**: map the Moon

[03:22:18] **Speaker**: 20 years ago all they're doing is

[03:22:20] **Speaker**: locating where the craters are where the

[03:22:23] **Speaker**: mountains are things like that they have

[03:22:25] **Speaker**: they can they don't know how to crack

[03:22:27] **Speaker**: the code aren't they trying to make
cyber people with like all the 
[03:22:30] **Speaker**: artificial

[03:22:31] **Speaker**: um like forms like there's a thing that

[03:22:34] **Speaker**: the president vetoed against artificial

[03:22:36] **Speaker**: law was it Gene Spicer is that what it

[03:22:39] **Speaker**: is or working on humans embryos but

[03:22:42] **Speaker**: that's that's typically accepted to be

[03:22:44] **Speaker**: inhumane yeah yeah

[03:22:48] **Speaker**: but then you know if you're not a member

[03:22:51] **Speaker**: of nation

[03:22:53] **Speaker**: just go to your own mad doctors Island

[03:22:55] **Speaker**: right yeah and uh but actually

[03:23:00] **Speaker**: um they've already done it they did it

[03:23:02] **Speaker**: with the tomatoes haven't you ever heard

[03:23:03] **Speaker**: the Tomato that's a fish

[03:23:13] **Speaker**: of the tomatoes

[03:23:19] **Speaker**: they use the DNA of the fish to make

[03:23:21] **Speaker**: that happen they do it because
potatoes 
[03:23:35] **Speaker**: Tomatoes it actually gotten like

[03:23:40] **Speaker**: here he says

[03:23:42] **Speaker**: when it really was a tomato and now it's

[03:23:45] **Speaker**: like it still looks like a tomato but it

[03:23:46] **Speaker**: hasn't gone rotten for two months or

[03:23:49] **Speaker**: something really we should keep it in an

[03:23:51] **Speaker**: aquarium where it belongs

[03:23:55] **Speaker**: yeah you're total vegetarians

[03:24:02] **Speaker**: no well it already happened though the

[03:24:04] **Speaker**: state of New York all the Gourmet chefs

[03:24:06] **Speaker**: and everything they signed a agreement

[03:24:08] **Speaker**: amongst themselves that they would never

[03:24:09] **Speaker**: in any their expensive gourmet

[03:24:11] **Speaker**: restaurants ever serve a genetically

[03:24:13] **Speaker**: engineered with a tomato but but all our

[03:24:17] **Speaker**: food is already engineering

[03:24:21] **Speaker**: yeah if you look at anything that's that

[03:24:23] **Speaker**: organic is engineered without petroleum

[03:24:25] **Speaker**: you have petroleum

[03:24:27] **Speaker**: well actually I I'm fighting a case I'm

[03:24:30] **Speaker**: about to sue a supermarket here Star

[03:24:32] **Speaker**: Market I actually was responsible for

[03:24:33] **Speaker**: the law becoming recognized

[03:24:37] **Speaker**: um because I I Tony commercial produce

[03:24:39] **Speaker**: as much as I can avoid it I like organic

[03:24:41] **Speaker**: and I don't like those coatings on

[03:24:43] **Speaker**: cucumbers they make me sick and stuff it

[03:24:46] **Speaker**: turns out that a lot of that stuff is

[03:24:48] **Speaker**: you know dangerous because the waxes are

[03:24:51] **Speaker**: fundamental the fundamental part of the
wax the wax is just the carrier the 
[03:24:55] **Speaker**: fundamental part of the ingredient of

[03:24:57] **Speaker**: the wax is the fungicides which are

[03:24:59] **Speaker**: chemicals that are used to actually kill

[03:25:02] **Speaker**: molds and things like that and these a

[03:25:05] **Speaker**: lot of these chemicals are called

[03:25:06] **Speaker**: economic poison and determine that

[03:25:09] **Speaker**: they'll um

[03:25:10] **Speaker**: kill five people for every million that

[03:25:13] **Speaker**: eat them which is considered an

[03:25:15] **Speaker**: allowable enough uh acceptable amount of

[03:25:19] **Speaker**: deaths because of the financial benefit

[03:25:22] **Speaker**: of it and they say it's an economic

[03:25:23] **Speaker**: legal economic poison because it would

[03:25:25] **Speaker**: cause economic Targets in the industry

[03:25:27] **Speaker**: and therefore those five people are

[03:25:29] **Speaker**: simply put Expendable yeah

[03:25:31] **Speaker**: and so um but the problem is we should

[03:25:34] **Speaker**: have the option to write especially for

[03:25:36] **Speaker**: what we call Value and safety

[03:25:38] **Speaker**: information comparisons to make a

[03:25:39] **Speaker**: decision on what we consume so when you

[03:25:41] **Speaker**: go in the supermarket you have a sign

[03:25:43] **Speaker**: you may be one of the five uh people as

[03:25:45] **Speaker**: a victim of this election right right

[03:25:48] **Speaker**: and I've read that I've read the uh the

[03:25:51] **Speaker**: uh autopsy uh surgeons reports on people
who did die it's pretty horrific how 
[03:25:56] **Speaker**: they died

[03:25:57] **Speaker**: usually it's anaphylactic shock okay

[03:26:14] **Speaker**: I don't want to scare you you should be

[03:26:16] **Speaker**: eating fruits and vegetables and you

[03:26:18] **Speaker**: should be consuming all these things I'm

[03:26:21] **Speaker**: a fruitarian I don't eat beef chicken

[03:26:22] **Speaker**: fish no milk no eggs and dairy nothing

[03:26:25] **Speaker**: but just living things sprouted things

[03:26:27] **Speaker**: stuff like that by yourself well

[03:26:31] **Speaker**: it's just just what you should do is go

[03:26:34] **Speaker**: into the cooler room and read the boxes

[03:26:35] **Speaker**: you know and everything in the freezer

[03:26:37] **Speaker**: section at the produce room it'll say

[03:26:40] **Speaker**: all those ingredients not as responsible

[03:26:42] **Speaker**: for getting all those laws enforced

[03:26:45] **Speaker**: properly and I and now I'm responsible

[03:26:47] **Speaker**: for the law that requires that there be

[03:26:49] **Speaker**: a five that there'd be a huge

[03:26:52] **Speaker**: prominently displayed card counter card

[03:26:54] **Speaker**: next to the fruit bins saying the wax

[03:26:56] **Speaker**: its function and its origin

[03:26:58] **Speaker**: and unfortunately a lot of these waxes

[03:27:01] **Speaker**: are made from animal products or insect

[03:27:04] **Speaker**: products shellac is a result of a

[03:27:06] **Speaker**: Lucifer shellac something type bug uh

[03:27:09] **Speaker**: what fatty acid esters which is a wax on

[03:27:13] **Speaker**: uh apples and tomatoes and cantaloupes

[03:27:15] **Speaker**: comes from beef towel that's an animal

[03:27:17] **Speaker**: product religious people it's not Kosher

[03:27:20] **Speaker**: you know Islamic people Jewish people

[03:27:23] **Speaker**: they don't want to eat this stuff and

[03:27:26] **Speaker**: this is commercial produce this is so

[03:27:27] **Speaker**: the supermarkets unfortunately the
supermarkets don't care because nobody 
[03:27:31] **Speaker**: ever

[03:27:31] **Speaker**: has taken them to court on this stuff

[03:27:34] **Speaker**: and that's why I'm going to do it it's

[03:27:35] **Speaker**: very hard to prove to

[03:27:37] **Speaker**: there's a law that requires on the

[03:27:39] **Speaker**: bosses that the supermarkets receive

[03:27:41] **Speaker**: that it mentions these chemicals because

[03:27:43] **Speaker**: these chemicals are incompatible with

[03:27:45] **Speaker**: one another we mix two of the raw

[03:27:46] **Speaker**: chemicals together and you die I haven't

[03:27:49] **Speaker**: like with the alar on not what was it

[03:27:52] **Speaker**: remember we had poison watermelons a

[03:27:54] **Speaker**: couple years ago you just can't take

[03:27:56] **Speaker**: this mix all these different things

[03:27:57] **Speaker**: together it becomes a poison cocktail so

[03:28:07] **Speaker**: that don't even have a resistance to the

[03:28:09] **Speaker**: stuff they were premature births

[03:28:12] **Speaker**: so I am
but I can't do all the things I'm supposed to be doing I'm supposed to be 
[03:28:17] **Speaker**: doing so much

[03:28:18] **Speaker**: and that's the problem because I I'm

[03:28:20] **Speaker**: limited as far as

[03:28:23] **Speaker**: I have to do everything myself because I

[03:28:24] **Speaker**: don't I don't have the resources

[03:28:27] **Speaker**: okay so

[03:28:29] **Speaker**: um

[03:28:30] **Speaker**: what we were talking about was anybody

[03:28:33] **Speaker**: like to make a point right now before I
proceed that was also 
[03:28:44] **Speaker**: like a wave of

[03:28:46] **Speaker**: my sound yeah

[03:28:49] **Speaker**: what you have is that you have the DNA

[03:28:52] **Speaker**: back on Helix is being displaced just

[03:28:54] **Speaker**: like you said there's something what

[03:28:56] **Speaker**: pushing them apart spreading apart there

[03:28:59] **Speaker**: is an invisible Flex field okay that's

[03:29:01] **Speaker**: responsible for the helical shape yeah

[03:29:03] **Speaker**: the conical helical shape is response

[03:29:07] **Speaker**: that's a higher field now the vortices

[03:29:10] **Speaker**: on DNA when I added the numbers to it

[03:29:12] **Speaker**: though they all lined up and DNA are you

[03:29:15] **Speaker**: familiar with how you have sister strand

[03:29:17] **Speaker**: where they duplicate the information and

[03:29:19] **Speaker**: they're perfect mirror that's what our

[03:29:20] **Speaker**: DNA is supposed to be doing and I found

[03:29:22] **Speaker**: that these nested vortices do that now

[03:29:24] **Speaker**: the nested vortices are right here

[03:29:28] **Speaker**: which is

[03:29:30] **Speaker**: let's look at two nested vortices

[03:29:32] **Speaker**: remember the nested vortices this one

[03:29:34] **Speaker**: and this one one two four eight seven

[03:29:36] **Speaker**: five going in and this one one two four

[03:29:38] **Speaker**: eight seven five is going out see how

[03:29:40] **Speaker**: this one's a negative one this is one

[03:29:42] **Speaker**: two four on the bottom this is a one two

[03:29:44] **Speaker**: four on the top they're two different

[03:29:45] **Speaker**: types of nested vortices and this shows

[03:29:48] **Speaker**: it right here boy these charts really do

[03:29:50] **Speaker**: belong together because that was the

[03:29:52] **Speaker**: goal see how these are staggered this

[03:29:54] **Speaker**: toroid is rigid it holds together and

[03:29:56] **Speaker**: what is DNA double spiral Helix do it

[03:29:59] **Speaker**: comes apart based on these two different

[03:30:01] **Speaker**: kinds of nested vortices how do these

[03:30:04] **Speaker**: nested vortices work and function oops

[03:30:07] **Speaker**: okay but how they line up based upon the

[03:30:11] **Speaker**: shears the world boundary conditions

[03:30:13] **Speaker**: which we've been studying like in the

[03:30:14] **Speaker**: yin and yang and the symbol where's the

[03:30:17] **Speaker**: boundary condition on the toroid it's

[03:30:19] **Speaker**: always equaling one remember how we did

[03:30:21] **Speaker**: that one and one is one two and five

[03:30:23] **Speaker**: times one four and seven is one eight

[03:30:24] **Speaker**: and eight is one see it's always the

[03:30:26] **Speaker**: same in between one and one is one two

[03:30:29] **Speaker**: plus ten always equals one which is what

[03:30:31] **Speaker**: you said was the yin and yang okay and

[03:30:34] **Speaker**: it really is making one what it does is

[03:30:36] **Speaker**: it allows you to have wires that go side

[03:30:38] **Speaker**: by side

[03:30:40] **Speaker**: and naturally it's late because they're

[03:30:42] **Speaker**: harmonics their resonance is so perfect

[03:30:44] **Speaker**: that they don't short circuit out

[03:30:47] **Speaker**: okay

[03:30:48] **Speaker**: everyone follow that

[03:30:51] **Speaker**: okay Charlie doesn't it doesn't have to

[03:30:53] **Speaker**: be understood

[03:30:55] **Speaker**: everything has to be a specific the

[03:30:57] **Speaker**: whole secret of this whole thing is

[03:30:59] **Speaker**: angle and ratio

[03:31:01] **Speaker**: okay that's what numbers are they have

[03:31:03] **Speaker**: geometric functions that are spatial and

[03:31:05] **Speaker**: temporal which is in your your worksheet

[03:31:08] **Speaker**: let's see can I have that worksheet
right there 
[03:31:20] **Speaker**: could I have that worksheet right there

[03:31:31] **Speaker**: um

[03:31:32] **Speaker**: this one yes

[03:31:35] **Speaker**: so here's some notes and what does it
explain s 
[03:31:48] **Speaker**: here it says it very clearly numbers are

[03:31:51] **Speaker**: relatives each number is just only in

[03:31:52] **Speaker**: relationship to all other numbers the

[03:31:54] **Speaker**: relationship is spatial and temporal

[03:31:57] **Speaker**: which is angle and ratio

[03:31:59] **Speaker**: there's many other things that this is
fun thank you um 
[03:32:09] **Speaker**: what do you mean by temporal

[03:32:12] **Speaker**: related to time
um yes um 
[03:32:18] **Speaker**: let's let's

[03:32:20] **Speaker**: the timing only one-sixth of this

[03:32:23] **Speaker**: clothes ever activated at one instance

[03:32:24] **Speaker**: these charts actually reflect what time

[03:32:27] **Speaker**: is

[03:32:28] **Speaker**: slant in that regard let's see which

[03:32:31] **Speaker**: chart that would be

[03:32:34] **Speaker**: um

[03:32:35] **Speaker**: right now

[03:32:38] **Speaker**: in this chart over here

[03:32:45] **Speaker**: okay

[03:32:46] **Speaker**: only our 396s are activated okay see I

[03:32:51] **Speaker**: just start three nine sixes are
activated 
[03:32:55] **Speaker**: okay uh but I'm actually showing the
knives but knives are always activated 
[03:32:58] **Speaker**: on the 396 I'm showing how everything

[03:33:00] **Speaker**: spins around let me find let me find the

[03:33:02] **Speaker**: family number group 147 which is a

[03:33:05] **Speaker**: little bit easier and here we go

[03:33:09] **Speaker**: I accidentally put it on upside down

[03:33:12] **Speaker**: here we're showing 147 on the outside of

[03:33:15] **Speaker**: the toroid yeah just one winding and it

[03:33:17] **Speaker**: would be this one four seven and that

[03:33:19] **Speaker**: one for 75 what I'm saying remember that

[03:33:21] **Speaker**: family group is on yeah okay and it's

[03:33:25] **Speaker**: always separated by thirds in every

[03:33:26] **Speaker**: direction see one then one two three

[03:33:29] **Speaker**: okay

[03:33:31] **Speaker**: diagonally it's always it would be one

[03:33:34] **Speaker**: four seven they would all be on at the

[03:33:35] **Speaker**: same time so diagonally we're thinking

[03:33:38] **Speaker**: that everything's on on this wire one

[03:33:39] **Speaker**: four seven they're all on

[03:33:41] **Speaker**: when this one's activated okay now

[03:33:46] **Speaker**: let's see what it looks like on the top

[03:33:48] **Speaker**: of the toroid

[03:33:49] **Speaker**: you can see all the windings one four

[03:33:51] **Speaker**: seven are on

[03:33:53] **Speaker**: let's go upside down but there's that

[03:33:55] **Speaker**: wire it's just one wire is on right now
and what it's doing is it's showing 
[03:33:59] **Speaker**: motion

[03:34:00] **Speaker**: how things move because when it goes off

[03:34:04] **Speaker**: and the next family number group moves

[03:34:07] **Speaker**: things move through the space it's like

[03:34:09] **Speaker**: the rest cycle they don't have to be

[03:34:11] **Speaker**: energized all the time you know we turn

[03:34:13] **Speaker**: on our Rockets they blast it we only

[03:34:16] **Speaker**: have turn on our jet packs for like

[03:34:18] **Speaker**: three seconds and we keep them shooting

[03:34:20] **Speaker**: through space so these tiles are

[03:34:22] **Speaker**: energized and then they're turned off

[03:34:24] **Speaker**: and then you jet through to the next

[03:34:26] **Speaker**: tile and you come out to the next space

[03:34:27] **Speaker**: where it'll be energized again

[03:34:29] **Speaker**: okay so sure enough so here you see in

[03:34:33] **Speaker**: this wire it's all positive seven one

[03:34:35] **Speaker**: fourths now what are where all the other

[03:34:37] **Speaker**: 714s are all negative they're on the

[03:34:39] **Speaker**: other wire now when we go to the next

[03:34:41] **Speaker**: stage which I didn't do a board because

[03:34:43] **Speaker**: it's just too many boards to do

[03:34:44] **Speaker**: it would have been 285 would have been

[03:34:47] **Speaker**: positive which is the next wire here's a

[03:34:48] **Speaker**: positive two positive eight positive

[03:34:50] **Speaker**: five and what about the two eight fives

[03:34:52] **Speaker**: are all negative over here so this wire

[03:34:54] **Speaker**: becomes positive do you follow what I'm

[03:34:56] **Speaker**: saying

[03:34:58] **Speaker**: say yes or no is there one known who
doesn't follow 
[03:35:01] **Speaker**: okay there's one

[03:35:03] **Speaker**: two three okay

[03:35:06] **Speaker**: I'm going to explain to you another way
I'm going to explain to you on the big 
[03:35:10] **Speaker**: board let's try and work on the big

[03:35:11] **Speaker**: amount okay

[03:35:14] **Speaker**: we're only interested about what is on

[03:35:16] **Speaker**: where right now one four and seven are

[03:35:20] **Speaker**: on okay in this wire which is also the

[03:35:23] **Speaker**: same as all these other wires where

[03:35:27] **Speaker**: there's a one four seven which is all

[03:35:28] **Speaker**: the same wire one I'll do the stock we

[03:35:31] **Speaker**: all understand that okay now the next

[03:35:34] **Speaker**: family now that doesn't stay on forever

[03:35:36] **Speaker**: because these little BB's shooting out

[03:35:38] **Speaker**: I'm really showing you them puncturing

[03:35:40] **Speaker**: the skin and disappearing into the outer

[03:35:41] **Speaker**: space

[03:35:43] **Speaker**: they're only on when the surface of the

[03:35:45] **Speaker**: toroid is hit by the z-axis as you

[03:35:49] **Speaker**: mentioned in the very beginning with

[03:35:51] **Speaker**: dementia

[03:35:53] **Speaker**: what this torque yeah well in terms of

[03:35:57] **Speaker**: in terms of the numbers skipping over

[03:35:59] **Speaker**: the uh the other group right well we'll

[03:36:01] **Speaker**: see well let's go to 258. the next

[03:36:04] **Speaker**: family member group that's activated is

[03:36:05] **Speaker**: not one four seven but it's going to be

[03:36:07] **Speaker**: two five eight and they're all over here

[03:36:09] **Speaker**: in the opposite wire so this wire is

[03:36:11] **Speaker**: totally off and when this y was on it

[03:36:14] **Speaker**: was all negative 1.7 is in that wire so

[03:36:16] **Speaker**: the other wire was off so right now we

[03:36:18] **Speaker**: got this total wires are all arms

[03:36:21] **Speaker**: while this total wire

[03:36:24] **Speaker**: is now all well

[03:36:26] **Speaker**: it's only one wire is ever on when the

[03:36:28] **Speaker**: other ones are off the right one or the

[03:36:30] **Speaker**: left one does everyone follow that now

[03:36:32] **Speaker**: they're not both going at the same time

[03:36:34] **Speaker**: the alternating

[03:36:36] **Speaker**: they're not even alternating because

[03:36:38] **Speaker**: it's based on thirds because then when

[03:36:40] **Speaker**: this one's off okay this one's on the

[03:36:44] **Speaker**: space where there's nothing

[03:36:46] **Speaker**: okay

[03:36:47] **Speaker**: that's why there's no resistance

[03:36:51] **Speaker**: okay and then it comes back to so this

[03:36:53] **Speaker**: is all on along here the 396s are all on

[03:36:57] **Speaker**: we can use

[03:36:59] **Speaker**: and then it comes back to the 147s again

[03:37:01] **Speaker**: so this one these are all on and then

[03:37:04] **Speaker**: these are all on and then the spaces are

[03:37:06] **Speaker**: all on and I wish I had sequence and

[03:37:08] **Speaker**: charts to show it neither to you but I

[03:37:10] **Speaker**: think you follow

[03:37:12] **Speaker**: it's probably awesome choice so I just

[03:37:14] **Speaker**: had a little flash here the um zero one

[03:37:17] **Speaker**: um you know computer system that is

[03:37:20] **Speaker**: unless it's based on is kind of like in

[03:37:22] **Speaker**: the mode 2 alley it's this or that off

[03:37:24] **Speaker**: or on when you based on three and nine

[03:37:27] **Speaker**: it created six yeah six it creates a

[03:37:31] **Speaker**: current that doesn't stop because it's

[03:37:33] **Speaker**: uh per month

[03:37:38] **Speaker**: um three nine and six obsolete zero one

[03:37:41] **Speaker**: doesn't even exist they think it exists

[03:37:43] **Speaker**: and they think they're making it work

[03:37:45] **Speaker**: it's like saying

[03:37:47] **Speaker**: um

[03:37:48] **Speaker**: we think we're more well what would be a

[03:37:50] **Speaker**: good analogy I don't give a nauseous one

[03:37:51] **Speaker**: let's just say their concept of zero and

[03:37:54] **Speaker**: one is is just their way of saying this

[03:37:59] **Speaker**: is what we're doing and this is how it

[03:38:00] **Speaker**: works it has nothing to do with math it

[03:38:02] **Speaker**: has nothing to do with electricity has

[03:38:03] **Speaker**: nothing to do with good computations

[03:38:13] **Speaker**: those extremes it's looking at it

[03:38:18] **Speaker**: when when they built

[03:38:20] **Speaker**: new computers with this

[03:38:23] **Speaker**: system would the computers be able to be

[03:38:26] **Speaker**: creative and imaginary artificial

[03:38:28] **Speaker**: intelligence

[03:38:31] **Speaker**: well okay let's take his question
okay 
[03:38:36] **Speaker**: say this question real loud one more

[03:38:38] **Speaker**: time while I look for the chart

[03:38:42] **Speaker**: see when the when the new

[03:38:44] **Speaker**: when the new computers start using this

[03:38:47] **Speaker**: tertiary system of course three six and

[03:38:50] **Speaker**: nine

[03:38:52] **Speaker**: would they be able to be imaginative and

[03:38:56] **Speaker**: creative as we are

[03:39:00] **Speaker**: we go we found it
um 
[03:39:10] **Speaker**: artificial intelligence

[03:39:12] **Speaker**: add infinite magnification the toroid is

[03:39:15] **Speaker**: recursive

[03:39:16] **Speaker**: okay
um 
[03:39:19] **Speaker**: quantum mechanical effects can be

[03:39:21] **Speaker**: duplicated on a microscopic level

[03:39:22] **Speaker**: utilizing this toroidal model process

[03:39:24] **Speaker**: okay

[03:39:26] **Speaker**: underlying coherence artificial

[03:39:29] **Speaker**: intelligence using the treasurer system

[03:39:31] **Speaker**: that you set so let's see how it works

[03:39:34] **Speaker**: okay

[03:39:36] **Speaker**: a fractal was with a fractal Judy you

[03:39:39] **Speaker**: mentioned a fractal would a fractal be

[03:39:41] **Speaker**: artificial intelligence

[03:39:44] **Speaker**: because it's self-similar it duplicates

[03:39:46] **Speaker**: itself from micro to macro that has a

[03:39:49] **Speaker**: element of uh novelty so let's say it is

[03:39:52] **Speaker**: okay would you accept that as an answer

[03:39:57] **Speaker**: there's a thing with the artificial

[03:40:00] **Speaker**: intelligence is that it has an input you

[03:40:03] **Speaker**: put your input into it but it also can

[03:40:05] **Speaker**: create things from that so it can

[03:40:07] **Speaker**: problem solve but it has a point that's

[03:40:11] **Speaker**: not that can't be figured they will just
called novelty I think or something like that 
[03:40:16] **Speaker**: it's like

[03:40:18] **Speaker**: there are other things

[03:40:20] **Speaker**: that it can think of besides what it's

[03:40:23] **Speaker**: what's been put into it let's say

[03:40:26] **Speaker**: artificial intelligence does start

[03:40:28] **Speaker**: defining our artificial intelligence

[03:40:30] **Speaker**: let's start to say that first of all

[03:40:31] **Speaker**: artificial intelligence is the fact that

[03:40:33] **Speaker**: we have a fountain here and it's making

[03:40:35] **Speaker**: a little water vortex okay but we have a

[03:40:39] **Speaker**: tornado and it's the same intelligence

[03:40:41] **Speaker**: but on a bigger scale a Vortex and let's

[03:40:44] **Speaker**: say we have a solar system which is our

[03:40:45] **Speaker**: galaxy and our planets and the Suns and

[03:40:48] **Speaker**: they're spiraling in a spiral of

[03:40:51] **Speaker**: system which is our galaxy and our

[03:40:53] **Speaker**: planets and the Suns and they're

[03:40:54] **Speaker**: spiraling in a spiral of a Vortex that's

[03:40:57] **Speaker**: would that be artificial intelligence

[03:40:58] **Speaker**: one definition that it can be the same

[03:41:01] **Speaker**: principle from small to big big to small

[03:41:03] **Speaker**: okay and we do know that those three

[03:41:05] **Speaker**: knowledges were the same so let's look

[03:41:07] **Speaker**: and see if this does the same principle

[03:41:09] **Speaker**: so that won't let's

[03:41:13] **Speaker**: won't be too easy but here is 7 times

[03:41:16] **Speaker**: 749 tiles it's the same tiles one two I

[03:41:20] **Speaker**: think I better show it here can you

[03:41:21] **Speaker**: erase what you have yeah I hate to say

[03:41:24] **Speaker**: it I can't it takes a special spray and

[03:41:26] **Speaker**: it takes a lot of elbow effort

[03:41:28] **Speaker**: that's the problem I'll try and work

[03:41:30] **Speaker**: right over here how's this

[03:41:32] **Speaker**: why don't I change colors
I don't know how well it'll come off 
[03:41:36] **Speaker**: should I go to black

[03:41:38] **Speaker**: let's see what happens

[03:41:40] **Speaker**: no I mean it comes off I mean

[03:41:43] **Speaker**: it's just true and false today

[03:41:46] **Speaker**: here we go

[03:41:50] **Speaker**: gotta start way up here

[03:41:53] **Speaker**: okay

[03:41:55] **Speaker**: remember the pattern that really made
this we did the multiplication series 
[03:41:59] **Speaker**: and everything but it really the most

[03:42:00] **Speaker**: important thing I think is these

[03:42:02] **Speaker**: doubling circuits in the 39639

[03:42:05] **Speaker**: okay everyone follow me so we have three

[03:42:08] **Speaker**: we have two things the doubling circuits

[03:42:10] **Speaker**: and the three nine six six nine three

[03:42:12] **Speaker**: really three things well it'll come off

[03:42:14] **Speaker**: should I go to black

[03:42:16] **Speaker**: let's see what happens

[03:42:18] **Speaker**: no I mean it comes off I mean
here we go 
[03:42:28] **Speaker**: gotta start way up here

[03:42:31] **Speaker**: okay

[03:42:33] **Speaker**: remember the pattern that really made
this we did the multiplication series 
[03:42:36] **Speaker**: and everything but it really the most

[03:42:38] **Speaker**: important thing I think is these

[03:42:40] **Speaker**: doubling circuits in the 39639 and uh

[03:42:43] **Speaker**: okay everyone follow me so we have three

[03:42:45] **Speaker**: we have two things the doubling circuits

[03:42:48] **Speaker**: and the three nine six six nine three

[03:42:50] **Speaker**: it's really three things but I'm just
lumping the doubling circuits together 
[03:42:53] **Speaker**: okay

[03:42:54] **Speaker**: so let's remember it's going one two

[03:42:57] **Speaker**: four eight seven five and it's making

[03:42:58] **Speaker**: this pattern over and over again okay I

[03:43:00] **Speaker**: think this would be kind of fun okay so

[03:43:02] **Speaker**: I'm gonna draw

[03:43:04] **Speaker**: it's kind of hard for me to do how many

[03:43:06] **Speaker**: have I done there okay

[03:43:10] **Speaker**: one two three four five

[03:43:15] **Speaker**: no I wish I did have this I think I

[03:43:19] **Speaker**: better buy a green okay let's do red
okay 
[03:43:26] **Speaker**: one two three four five

[03:43:30] **Speaker**: okay

[03:43:31] **Speaker**: one two three four five

[03:43:34] **Speaker**: someone laughing what was that you said

[03:43:37] **Speaker**: you need some fruit all right
thanks 
[03:43:43] **Speaker**: I hey I accept Okay

[03:43:48] **Speaker**: banana trick time okay watch this

[03:43:52] **Speaker**: we're all gonna go to dinner tonight

[03:43:54] **Speaker**: after I was gonna invite everybody to

[03:43:56] **Speaker**: what restaurant bar Roxbury the raw

[03:43:59] **Speaker**: experience

[03:44:00] **Speaker**: okay is this banana does it look round

[03:44:09] **Speaker**: my finger

[03:44:11] **Speaker**: where you can eat that many

[03:44:16] **Speaker**: how can you do that

[03:44:18] **Speaker**: now look you see I'm squishing it is

[03:44:20] **Speaker**: everyone watching this

[03:44:22] **Speaker**: um um making it malleable

[03:44:25] **Speaker**: is that mallulating it

[03:44:27] **Speaker**: and watch how it breaks

[03:44:31] **Speaker**: you play with your food all the time no

[03:44:33] **Speaker**: but I do this I don't know why and then
I split yeah 
[03:44:39] **Speaker**: it's so innate it's so

[03:44:43] **Speaker**: so like what do you call it intrinsic or

[03:44:46] **Speaker**: something it just you know it when you

[03:44:48] **Speaker**: say and you explain this stuff it's like

[03:44:50] **Speaker**: you go oh of course that's when I was

[03:44:52] **Speaker**: like three years old staring at the

[03:44:54] **Speaker**: floor and I saw these patterns within

[03:44:56] **Speaker**: the tile on the floor and you go you

[03:44:58] **Speaker**: know what I mean it's three parts I know

[03:45:01] **Speaker**: exactly you remember when your

[03:45:03] **Speaker**: three-year-old still doing it before

[03:45:15] **Speaker**: so we agree we're back to thirds again
okay 
[03:45:23] **Speaker**: it will actually make me tired I don't

[03:45:26] **Speaker**: eat till I'm done presenting

[03:45:30] **Speaker**: what was your original question

[03:45:34] **Speaker**: artificial intelligence

[03:45:37] **Speaker**: um yeah well I just but you just

[03:45:39] **Speaker**: outlined a circuit there so you might as

[03:45:41] **Speaker**: well I mean you outline the five black

[03:45:43] **Speaker**: lives here right which is the artificial

[03:45:46] **Speaker**: intelligence

[03:45:47] **Speaker**: we're coming to that
okay 
[03:46:00] **Speaker**: what you said at the very beginning was

[03:46:02] **Speaker**: love

[03:46:04] **Speaker**: and a computer is trying to think for

[03:46:08] **Speaker**: itself that doesn't have the element of

[03:46:10] **Speaker**: Love is going to end up being something

[03:46:12] **Speaker**: related except I learned a long

[03:46:14] **Speaker**: commentary so the second you say no or

[03:46:16] **Speaker**: it's not possible you're usually wrong

[03:46:18] **Speaker**: yeah but

[03:46:21] **Speaker**: I agree with you something that is

[03:46:24] **Speaker**: strictly three-dimensional which you

[03:46:26] **Speaker**: know does not have the capacity of the

[03:46:28] **Speaker**: entire dimension on my fourth there's

[03:46:31] **Speaker**: only there's only above the third

[03:46:32] **Speaker**: dimensions on my fourth dimension

[03:46:34] **Speaker**: there's no six seven eight nine

[03:46:35] **Speaker**: dimensions the online Dimension is the

[03:46:38] **Speaker**: nine and the fourth is the the three and

[03:46:42] **Speaker**: six of the fourth dimension which

[03:46:44] **Speaker**: represent magnetism three and six is

[03:46:46] **Speaker**: magnetism the one to four eight seven

[03:46:48] **Speaker**: five represent electricity in between

[03:46:50] **Speaker**: the one two four seven five you always

[03:46:52] **Speaker**: have between six which is the magnetism

[03:46:54] **Speaker**: and in between the three and six you

[03:46:55] **Speaker**: always have benign which is the Theta

[03:46:58] **Speaker**: particle the ethron flux the spirit the

[03:47:01] **Speaker**: um

[03:47:03] **Speaker**: as far as making things and doing things

[03:47:05] **Speaker**: so in artificial intelligence and stuff

[03:47:06] **Speaker**: like that
um 
[03:47:13] **Speaker**: I really cannot come

[03:47:16] **Speaker**: is

[03:47:18] **Speaker**: okay

[03:47:19] **Speaker**: so let's take a look at what we're doing

[03:47:22] **Speaker**: with five boxes
um 
[03:47:30] **Speaker**: this was the number five was right in

[03:47:32] **Speaker**: the middle we had five like that correct

[03:47:35] **Speaker**: five was in the inside

[03:47:37] **Speaker**: okay so we come down five now we're

[03:47:40] **Speaker**: going in odd amounts one two three four

[03:47:42] **Speaker**: five so we come down five

[03:47:45] **Speaker**: okay and where's one two three four five

[03:47:49] **Speaker**: so this was it right here

[03:47:51] **Speaker**: okay and what's the number in the center

[03:47:54] **Speaker**: well that's exactly what belongs because

[03:47:56] **Speaker**: and what's going to be if there's a five

[03:47:58] **Speaker**: there and a seven there it's going to be
you know there's got to be an eight 
[03:48:02] **Speaker**: because eight double is seven seven

[03:48:03] **Speaker**: decibels is 14 which is five so sure

[03:48:05] **Speaker**: enough we count down five

[03:48:08] **Speaker**: okay is that five two oops

[03:48:13] **Speaker**: okay and what's the number in the center

[03:48:17] **Speaker**: okay so what's the number between four

[03:48:19] **Speaker**: and eight a four

[03:48:21] **Speaker**: well did I do it right seven one two

[03:48:24] **Speaker**: three four five eight eight seven five

[03:48:27] **Speaker**: so there's got to be a four down

[03:48:33] **Speaker**: okay is that five two oh sorry

[03:48:38] **Speaker**: okay and what's the number in the center

[03:48:42] **Speaker**: okay and what's the number between four

[03:48:44] **Speaker**: and eight a four

[03:48:46] **Speaker**: well did I do it right seven one two

[03:48:49] **Speaker**: three four five eight eight seven five
so there's got to be a four 
[03:48:57] **Speaker**: th okay but it should be far away

[03:49:00] **Speaker**: oh it is one two three four five oh yeah

[03:49:06] **Speaker**: hey that's pretty heavy duty

[03:49:11] **Speaker**: yeah it's like his invention so the

[03:49:14] **Speaker**: center numbers

[03:49:16] **Speaker**: right the center

[03:49:19] **Speaker**: the centers are moving it's still alive

[03:49:21] **Speaker**: yes what do you think Charlie said real

[03:49:24] **Speaker**: loud the center numbers are moving
according to our 
[03:49:29] **Speaker**: well if you do the one right over next

[03:49:32] **Speaker**: the um not only the center number is the
circuit which are the doubling circuits 
[03:49:36] **Speaker**: what about the three nine six six nine

[03:49:38] **Speaker**: three so I actually have the pattern

[03:49:40] **Speaker**: which is um is this it here okay so

[03:49:44] **Speaker**: we'll do we'll do right here one two

[03:49:47] **Speaker**: three four five one two three four five

[03:49:51] **Speaker**: Center one
so 
[03:49:54] **Speaker**: um

[03:49:55] **Speaker**: I took it off by two I staggered them

[03:49:57] **Speaker**: yeah one two three four five

[03:50:00] **Speaker**: so it's kind of confusing so right now

[03:50:03] **Speaker**: we've got another doubling circuit going

[03:50:04] **Speaker**: in the reverse Direction and if we go

[03:50:07] **Speaker**: over here we'll have a 396-693 which
will be 
[03:50:13] **Speaker**: okay

[03:50:14] **Speaker**: I'm trying to do oh here it is right

[03:50:17] **Speaker**: okay so here we have a six right it goes

[03:50:21] **Speaker**: like this oh yeah it's called philotaxis

[03:50:24] **Speaker**: in plants

[03:50:25] **Speaker**: it's the same pattern and here's a nine

[03:50:27] **Speaker**: one two three four five it's making the

[03:50:30] **Speaker**: whole thing with the spaces and

[03:50:32] **Speaker**: everything that's the self-similarity of

[03:50:34] **Speaker**: hearing isn't it exactly and you can do

[03:50:37] **Speaker**: that with six you could do that with six

[03:50:38] **Speaker**: couldn't no you couldn't because you

[03:50:42] **Speaker**: chose groups of five because we've

[03:50:44] **Speaker**: already covered groups of three right

[03:50:46] **Speaker**: and I did we've already we haven't

[03:50:48] **Speaker**: covered groups of two but everyone that

[03:50:50] **Speaker**: we choose has another wisdom one will

[03:50:53] **Speaker**: always equal the number in the center

[03:51:04] **Speaker**: two well which is 2 which is a square

[03:51:07] **Speaker**: again we're just doing squares oh I got

[03:51:10] **Speaker**: you okay which is two by two okay equals

[03:51:13] **Speaker**: nine four plus three is seven something

[03:51:15] **Speaker**: three times one eight one is nine I can

[03:51:17] **Speaker**: take any four three and eight and four

[03:51:19] **Speaker**: and three well which is two which is a

[03:51:21] **Speaker**: square again we're just doing squares oh

[03:51:23] **Speaker**: I got you yeah okay which is two by two

[03:51:26] **Speaker**: okay equals nine four plus three is

[03:51:28] **Speaker**: seven seven three times one eighty one

[03:51:30] **Speaker**: is nine I can take any four three and

[03:51:32] **Speaker**: eight and four and three equals

[03:51:35] **Speaker**: um what's this equal uh eighteen nine

[03:51:38] **Speaker**: nine equals nine right so even numbers

[03:51:41] **Speaker**: will always equal a nine what do you

[03:51:43] **Speaker**: mean even even Square so two by two is

[03:51:46] **Speaker**: four by fours right six by six what and

[03:51:51] **Speaker**: uh one by one is a pod and what is a

[03:51:55] **Speaker**: three by three a three by three was

[03:51:57] **Speaker**: making this whole pattern of the nine at

[03:51:59] **Speaker**: the center and um

[03:52:02] **Speaker**: of course I hadn't taken the three by

[03:52:04] **Speaker**: three and put it off to the side and see

[03:52:06] **Speaker**: which one it was what it would have done
um 
[03:52:09] **Speaker**: four by four would have been a nine

[03:52:11] **Speaker**: let's do a four by four

[03:52:13] **Speaker**: okay this these four groups were the

[03:52:16] **Speaker**: people of nine okay what's the five by

[03:52:18] **Speaker**: five uh we just did it equals the

[03:52:20] **Speaker**: doubling circuits and the equal

[03:52:21] **Speaker**: potential major group five by five is a

[03:52:23] **Speaker**: doubling right seven by sevens here's

[03:52:26] **Speaker**: seven by sevens doubling circuits here's

[03:52:29] **Speaker**: oh no here's seven by seven here's five

[03:52:31] **Speaker**: by five and then make the same five how

[03:52:33] **Speaker**: about these uh nine by nine

[03:52:35] **Speaker**: nine by nines yeah it's real deep

[03:52:38] **Speaker**: serious stuff that you have to be a

[03:52:40] **Speaker**: genius to understand yeah

[03:52:42] **Speaker**: I'm not the genius oh you don't know

[03:52:45] **Speaker**: it's goes three nine six I know I should

[03:52:47] **Speaker**: say sandwiches but

[03:52:49] **Speaker**: I just have to be a genius to understand

[03:52:51] **Speaker**: yeah

[03:52:53] **Speaker**: I'm not the genius oh you don't know

[03:52:55] **Speaker**: it's goes three nine six I know I should

[03:52:57] **Speaker**: say I'm a genius but yeah I just it's

[03:53:01] **Speaker**: that profound it goes it turns from

[03:53:03] **Speaker**: doubling circuits and all this stuff it

[03:53:06] **Speaker**: turns into three six three six and then

[03:53:08] **Speaker**: it goes 999 and it all means something

[03:53:11] **Speaker**: and it's all modeling the higher

[03:53:12] **Speaker**: Dimension and it's just too deep have

[03:53:14] **Speaker**: you done 11 by 11.

[03:53:16] **Speaker**: um probably not I think I was happy

[03:53:18] **Speaker**: doing all the analogies and all the

[03:53:20] **Speaker**: different variations and I was going to

[03:53:21] **Speaker**: leave it for people like yourself to do

[03:53:24] **Speaker**: huh well I'm sure I'll try yeah yeah

[03:53:28] **Speaker**: well it takes a lot of paper but I wish

[03:53:30] **Speaker**: I could get

[03:53:31] **Speaker**: um a chart like that

[03:53:34] **Speaker**: because then you could play all day with

[03:53:35] **Speaker**: it a big one yeah that was really

[03:53:38] **Speaker**: erasable yeah a whiteboard well if you

[03:53:41] **Speaker**: pay the shipping I'll get you the white

[03:53:43] **Speaker**: I'll get you one this big I could
probably but you got one well you know 
[03:53:46] **Speaker**: one of the things I ought to do with my

[03:53:47] **Speaker**: classes have them make this right

[03:53:55] **Speaker**: if they can understand and explain it

[03:53:57] **Speaker**: and they can win the Nobel Prize because

[03:54:00] **Speaker**: they'll explain it to the world which I

[03:54:02] **Speaker**: haven't done in class they should they

[03:54:04] **Speaker**: should be able to uh I should be able to
explain it to them and they can make it 
[03:54:07] **Speaker**: up

[03:54:08] **Speaker**: and put tape on a whiteboard so let me

[03:54:11] **Speaker**: figure out all the accents yeah we can

[03:54:12] **Speaker**: play with it though for a long time

[03:54:15] **Speaker**: that's right do you want to explain to

[03:54:17] **Speaker**: the world yeah but no I don't want to

[03:54:20] **Speaker**: explain for you I want you to explain to
the world 
[03:54:27] **Speaker**: well that's kind of yeah but um

[03:54:29] **Speaker**: the problem is see

[03:54:32] **Speaker**: what do you mean I explained much better

[03:54:33] **Speaker**: than you well because you know I think

[03:54:35] **Speaker**: I'm gonna be able to explain

[03:54:37] **Speaker**: and TV sets going vertical and

[03:54:40] **Speaker**: horizontal with the Z thing going back

[03:54:41] **Speaker**: and forth every one of us have people

[03:54:44] **Speaker**: that circumambulate around us okay we

[03:54:46] **Speaker**: each have our own world of friends and

[03:54:48] **Speaker**: stuff like that and there's only certain

[03:54:49] **Speaker**: people that will understand identify and

[03:54:51] **Speaker**: relate to you yeah you need experts in

[03:54:54] **Speaker**: their field to uh get into this who then

[03:54:57] **Speaker**: could adapt it to their field and see

[03:54:59] **Speaker**: the patterns appearing in their field

[03:55:01] **Speaker**: who really have done a lot of

[03:55:02] **Speaker**: experimentation like like a biochemist

[03:55:10] **Speaker**: that's what you said I'm saying that and

[03:55:13] **Speaker**: I'm and I'm also saying that
um 
[03:55:19] **Speaker**: that

[03:55:21] **Speaker**: I can't take I can't do anything more

[03:55:23] **Speaker**: because like the experts that he's

[03:55:25] **Speaker**: talking about I don't have the

[03:55:29] **Speaker**: the books you know it's the money to buy

[03:55:32] **Speaker**: these books to study these topics around

[03:55:34] **Speaker**: the teachers no I'm not even doing
connections 
[03:55:43] **Speaker**: yeah
um 
[03:55:47] **Speaker**: the only work that I'm willing to do

[03:55:49] **Speaker**: further on this per se is either the

[03:55:52] **Speaker**: periodic table of elements

[03:55:54] **Speaker**: computers or biology modeling genetics

[03:55:58] **Speaker**: because my abilities to do stuff that's

[03:56:01] **Speaker**: pretty much impossible for people

[03:56:03] **Speaker**: okay figuring out things are impossible

[03:56:05] **Speaker**: and I think the genetics these are all

[03:56:07] **Speaker**: codes and traces enough of it that

[03:56:09] **Speaker**: people can start figuring it out on
their own but I know those are tough 
[03:56:13] **Speaker**: ones

[03:56:14] **Speaker**: and so I really don't mind approaching

[03:56:17] **Speaker**: those and using my abilities and Powers

[03:56:19] **Speaker**: what I really don't want to do though is

[03:56:21] **Speaker**: um

[03:56:23] **Speaker**: is is well I don't know I don't have the

[03:56:26] **Speaker**: strength I just don't have I don't I'm

[03:56:29] **Speaker**: that

[03:56:31] **Speaker**: spread out too thin you know I just I

[03:56:33] **Speaker**: don't travel to the mainland

[03:56:35] **Speaker**: I don't uh they offer me to pay my

[03:56:37] **Speaker**: airfare they pay you my hotel I can't

[03:56:39] **Speaker**: handle it this is too exhaustive so so

[03:56:42] **Speaker**: my goal is is that um

[03:56:45] **Speaker**: you guys do it okay okay

[03:56:53] **Speaker**: um

[03:56:55] **Speaker**: so

[03:56:57] **Speaker**: um the law of numbers

[03:57:01] **Speaker**: passing on the energy is the shame as

[03:57:04] **Speaker**: the concept same as all the laws of

[03:57:07] **Speaker**: physics

[03:57:08] **Speaker**: it's all connected

[03:57:10] **Speaker**: seeing the harmonics and the vibration
um 
[03:57:31] **Speaker**: okay

[03:57:33] **Speaker**: I guess we'll go to the brain

[03:57:36] **Speaker**: oh I know I told you I'd come back to

[03:57:38] **Speaker**: we're down to our last 10 minutes

[03:57:41] **Speaker**: there's the alphabet there's the numbers

[03:57:44] **Speaker**: it's a system used by billions of people

[03:57:46] **Speaker**: I'm not going to go into that Thief

[03:57:48] **Speaker**: people go into something that I can

[03:57:50] **Speaker**: teach you

[03:57:51] **Speaker**: that no one else will say

[03:57:53] **Speaker**: this is Neuron migration I call this

[03:57:55] **Speaker**: life-giving biophysical harmonics I

[03:57:58] **Speaker**: think I'm going to

[03:58:00] **Speaker**: there's a lot of facts a lot of basis

[03:58:03] **Speaker**: that I could explain that by

[03:58:07] **Speaker**: um

[03:58:08] **Speaker**: but I'll just tell you how I know it

[03:58:13] **Speaker**: um

[03:58:14] **Speaker**: the brain

[03:58:17] **Speaker**: okay

[03:58:18] **Speaker**: you don't teach children

[03:58:21] **Speaker**: Mary Works Marlene's good friend

[03:58:25] **Speaker**: works at what's the name of the school

[03:58:29] **Speaker**: Horizons New Horizons

[03:58:32] **Speaker**: okay which is a school for disabled

[03:58:35] **Speaker**: children

[03:58:36] **Speaker**: handicapped learning things like that

[03:58:39] **Speaker**: um

[03:58:40] **Speaker**: they teach him each letter at a time

[03:58:43] **Speaker**: MBT how to Sam how to Doom what I

[03:58:47] **Speaker**: discovered was is if you there are focal

[03:58:50] **Speaker**: centers and if you learn

[03:58:52] **Speaker**: the nine if you learn the letters of the

[03:58:55] **Speaker**: name of God the sounds meditation

[03:58:58] **Speaker**: however you want to refer to this mantis

[03:59:00] **Speaker**: whatever you actually

[03:59:02] **Speaker**: can learn all those other letters I

[03:59:04] **Speaker**: could take those children teach them a

[03:59:07] **Speaker**: specific sound

[03:59:09] **Speaker**: I say the name of God this is real weird

[03:59:11] **Speaker**: but when I say the name of God instead

[03:59:13] **Speaker**: of saying it's superlative case in the

[03:59:15] **Speaker**: Baha'i religion is of the name of God is

[03:59:18] **Speaker**: said to be the highest it's supposed to
be the Heavenly world within this 
[03:59:22] **Speaker**: physical world

[03:59:23] **Speaker**: physical worlds referred to as Baja

[03:59:26] **Speaker**: and um

[03:59:28] **Speaker**: that's why a prophet was named and it's

[03:59:31] **Speaker**: called the most great name it's 360

[03:59:33] **Speaker**: degrees

[03:59:35] **Speaker**: so what I did was I the superlative

[03:59:37] **Speaker**: cases up top means glorious life

[03:59:40] **Speaker**: Splendor I'm going to translate it so to

[03:59:43] **Speaker**: say that name I don't go

[03:59:45] **Speaker**: because I saw the b h on conjunction

[03:59:48] **Speaker**: with two and five it's I'll pause one

[03:59:50] **Speaker**: two five one and I concentrate on the

[03:59:52] **Speaker**: one and the one isn't said as a vowel

[03:59:55] **Speaker**: it's pure breath it's in any vow they

[03:59:58] **Speaker**: teach in Arabic which is the aleph which

[04:00:00] **Speaker**: begins out of heart is a consonant

[04:00:03] **Speaker**: so I took the number one which is a

[04:00:06] **Speaker**: consonant which is called the glottal

[04:00:07] **Speaker**: stop it's set in your throat it's like

[04:00:10] **Speaker**: in Hawaiian we see it in all the the

[04:00:12] **Speaker**: Hawaiian names

[04:00:14] **Speaker**: and you have a consonant

[04:00:18] **Speaker**: beginning the vowel so I realized that

[04:00:21] **Speaker**: the first and there's only one out now

[04:00:23] **Speaker**: how there's two vowels but there's only

[04:00:25] **Speaker**: one which is at the beginning and the

[04:00:26] **Speaker**: other vowel is connected to that

[04:00:28] **Speaker**: so to say our part correctly
I say 
[04:00:34] **Speaker**: I can't even tell what I'm doing I'm

[04:00:35] **Speaker**: holding the glottal stop eternally and

[04:00:38] **Speaker**: it's just

[04:00:39] **Speaker**: and I'm vibrating this

[04:00:42] **Speaker**: and this is how I had all the energy to

[04:00:44] **Speaker**: do all this work and why I did it it's

[04:00:45] **Speaker**: just that simple this there's so much

[04:00:48] **Speaker**: more I could have shown you I threw away

[04:00:49] **Speaker**: 500 pounds of pages enough on this stuff

[04:00:53] **Speaker**: you do that to gain energy to keep up my

[04:00:57] **Speaker**: energy

[04:00:58] **Speaker**: that's right

[04:01:01] **Speaker**: that's great thanks yeah yeah when we do

[04:01:05] **Speaker**: yoga when I when I start resonating from

[04:01:07] **Speaker**: there you can feel it

[04:01:10] **Speaker**: together we do the old

[04:01:14] **Speaker**: that starts going and it's resonates and

[04:01:18] **Speaker**: b h same thing compression decompression

[04:01:20] **Speaker**: together so

[04:01:23] **Speaker**: see if you can make the sound a BHA

[04:01:25] **Speaker**: concentrating on the Eternal Palms on
the front 
[04:01:36] **Speaker**: oh wow you guys are good yeah wow
say that again 
[04:01:46] **Speaker**: oh that's right

[04:01:49] **Speaker**: interestingly the letter b

[04:01:53] **Speaker**: in

[04:01:54] **Speaker**: you are my sounded real great you say

[04:01:56] **Speaker**: the name of God perfectly now the letter

[04:01:58] **Speaker**: B in the scriptures is referred to the

[04:02:00] **Speaker**: trumpet and it's said to be a bottomless

[04:02:03] **Speaker**: sea which none can ever fathom and it

[04:02:05] **Speaker**: says it's the blackest of nice so the

[04:02:07] **Speaker**: letter B is the and then he refers to

[04:02:09] **Speaker**: the H's as garment blowing and they

[04:02:12] **Speaker**: they're in conjunction and so that B

[04:02:14] **Speaker**: that bottom so instead of how we

[04:02:15] **Speaker**: normally say up high with their lips

[04:02:18] **Speaker**: we're saying it in here

[04:02:20] **Speaker**: because it's a song it's like the

[04:02:22] **Speaker**: Nightingale it's a bird it's much faster
so 
[04:02:29] **Speaker**: the B the b h I'm doing all once the b h

[04:02:33] **Speaker**: just become the two of the shape just

[04:02:35] **Speaker**: the that's the one two four that's the

[04:02:38] **Speaker**: one two four eight seven five that's the

[04:02:40] **Speaker**: coil that does it that stays but the 396

[04:02:43] **Speaker**: is the energy it's releasing which is

[04:02:46] **Speaker**: the one but the one in the LF which

[04:02:48] **Speaker**: represents

[04:02:50] **Speaker**: the vowels actually Taps into the 396. I

[04:02:54] **Speaker**: don't fully understand how Charlie well

[04:03:00] **Speaker**: yeah

[04:03:01] **Speaker**: and that's exactly right that's what

[04:03:04] **Speaker**: we're modeling here this equation that's

[04:03:05] **Speaker**: the last half of this equation which is

[04:03:07] **Speaker**: five one sounds like the the like if

[04:03:10] **Speaker**: it's like the source the ah and the B

[04:03:12] **Speaker**: would be the receptive of the two in in

[04:03:15] **Speaker**: uh which would be the Earth and then the

[04:03:18] **Speaker**: hot would be like the soul breath which

[04:03:21] **Speaker**: is the connection or something something

[04:03:22] **Speaker**: like that you know what I'm saying yeah

[04:03:26] **Speaker**: I do know what you're saying

[04:03:28] **Speaker**: um

[04:03:29] **Speaker**: and they um

[04:03:45] **Speaker**: which is two which is a square again

[04:03:48] **Speaker**: we're just doing squares oh I got you

[04:03:50] **Speaker**: okay which is two by two okay equals

[04:03:53] **Speaker**: nine four plus three is seven seven

[04:03:55] **Speaker**: three cents one eighty one is nine I can

[04:03:57] **Speaker**: take any four three and eight and four

[04:03:59] **Speaker**: and three equals

[04:04:01] **Speaker**: um what's it equal

[04:04:03] **Speaker**: uh eighteen nine nine nine equals nine

[04:04:06] **Speaker**: right so even numbers will always equal

[04:04:08] **Speaker**: a nine what do you mean even even

[04:04:10] **Speaker**: squares even so two by two is four by

[04:04:13] **Speaker**: fours right six by six by six

[04:04:16] **Speaker**: and uh one by one

[04:04:21] **Speaker**: a three by three was making this whole

[04:04:24] **Speaker**: pattern of the nine at the center and um

[04:04:28] **Speaker**: of course I hadn't taken the three by
three and put it off to the side and see which one it would what it would have done um 
[04:04:35] **Speaker**: four by four would have been a nine

[04:04:37] **Speaker**: let's do a four by four

[04:04:40] **Speaker**: okay this these four groups would have

[04:04:42] **Speaker**: equaled nine okay what's the five by

[04:04:44] **Speaker**: five uh we just did it equals the

[04:04:46] **Speaker**: doubling circuits and the equal

[04:04:47] **Speaker**: potential major groups five by five is a

[04:04:49] **Speaker**: doubling circuit right and seven by

[04:04:51] **Speaker**: sevens here's seven by sevens doubling

[04:04:54] **Speaker**: circuits here's uh no here's seven by

[04:04:56] **Speaker**: sevens here's five by five and then make

[04:04:58] **Speaker**: the same five how about these uh hit

[04:05:00] **Speaker**: nine by nine that's what happens there

[04:05:01] **Speaker**: nine by nines yeah it's real deep

[04:05:04] **Speaker**: serious stuff that you have to be a

[04:05:06] **Speaker**: genius to understand yeah

[04:05:08] **Speaker**: I'm not the genius oh you don't know

[04:05:11] **Speaker**: it's goes three nine six I know I should

[04:05:13] **Speaker**: say sandwiches but yeah

[04:05:15] **Speaker**: I just uh hard with her lips for saying

[04:05:19] **Speaker**: it in here

[04:05:20] **Speaker**: because it's a song it's like the

[04:05:22] **Speaker**: Nightingale it's a bird it's much faster

[04:05:29] **Speaker**: so the B the b h I'm doing it all at

[04:05:32] **Speaker**: once the b h just become the tube the

[04:05:34] **Speaker**: shape just the that's the one two four

[04:05:37] **Speaker**: that's the one two four eight seven five

[04:05:39] **Speaker**: that's the coil that does it that stays

[04:05:41] **Speaker**: but the 396 is the energy it's releasing

[04:05:45] **Speaker**: which is the one but the one in the LF

[04:05:48] **Speaker**: which represents

[04:05:49] **Speaker**: the vowels actually Taps into the 396. I

[04:05:53] **Speaker**: don't fully understand how Charlie well

[04:05:56] **Speaker**: the H in Hawaiian is a symbol of the

[04:05:59] **Speaker**: breath and the Soul yeah

[04:06:01] **Speaker**: and that's exactly right that's what

[04:06:03] **Speaker**: we're modeling here this equation that's

[04:06:05] **Speaker**: the last half of this equation which is

[04:06:07] **Speaker**: five one sounds like the the like it's

[04:06:10] **Speaker**: like the source the ah and the B would

[04:06:12] **Speaker**: be the receptive of the two in in the

[04:06:15] **Speaker**: each egg which would be the Earth and

[04:06:18] **Speaker**: then the Hound would be like the soul

[04:06:19] **Speaker**: breath which is the connection or on top

[04:06:22] **Speaker**: of something like that you know

[04:06:24] **Speaker**: yeah I do know what you're saying

[04:06:28] **Speaker**: um

[04:06:28] **Speaker**: and they um

[04:06:34] **Speaker**: just like Alpha

[04:06:36] **Speaker**: here's the one two

[04:06:38] **Speaker**: five one throw upon is two and five on

[04:06:40] **Speaker**: Baja which is three six which equals

[04:06:42] **Speaker**: nine it was always the one connecting

[04:06:44] **Speaker**: back I mean the two and five connecting
back to one 
[04:06:48] **Speaker**: which was the whole equation so the

[04:06:49] **Speaker**: whole equation of this whole Torrid coil

[04:06:51] **Speaker**: everything we've seen this evening is

[04:06:53] **Speaker**: two one five one that's an anagram

[04:06:56] **Speaker**: oh I didn't show you the underground
remember I said I was going to show you 
[04:06:59] **Speaker**: the anagram

[04:07:00] **Speaker**: but that's an anagram

[04:07:03] **Speaker**: will you well look at this the the thing

[04:07:06] **Speaker**: that's most famous for the anagram and

[04:07:08] **Speaker**: our ground you familiar with it

[04:07:09] **Speaker**: everybody you seen it okay watch this

[04:07:11] **Speaker**: look at the doubling circuits remember

[04:07:13] **Speaker**: we did

[04:07:15] **Speaker**: um well here's one two three four five

[04:07:17] **Speaker**: six seven eight nine and one two one

[04:07:19] **Speaker**: four two eight five seven one is any

[04:07:22] **Speaker**: number one through nine divided by seven

[04:07:24] **Speaker**: equals

[04:07:25] **Speaker**: the um the anagram that number series we

[04:07:30] **Speaker**: familiar with that yes we are let's see

[04:07:34] **Speaker**: um any number divided by seven is on

[04:07:36] **Speaker**: chart

[04:07:38] **Speaker**: um

[04:07:40] **Speaker**: see if I can find it

[04:07:42] **Speaker**: I know right where that changes so I
know which chart it is 
[04:07:55] **Speaker**: are we talking what modular seven no

[04:07:59] **Speaker**: take one yeah and divide it by seven

[04:08:06] **Speaker**: here it is

[04:08:07] **Speaker**: I like a guy who does it in his head and

[04:08:10] **Speaker**: gives you the answer okay there it is

[04:08:12] **Speaker**: right here uh one four two eight five

[04:08:15] **Speaker**: seven yeah okay but the problem is if

[04:08:19] **Speaker**: any number divided by that like two yeah

[04:08:21] **Speaker**: because it's doubled it's the same

[04:08:23] **Speaker**: pattern two eight five seven one four

[04:08:25] **Speaker**: eight two

[04:08:27] **Speaker**: okay now watch you ready for this one

[04:08:29] **Speaker**: Charlie would you believe that that's

[04:08:31] **Speaker**: our Taurus

[04:08:32] **Speaker**: let's leave it now

[04:08:34] **Speaker**: okay okay oh but wait it gets more

[04:08:37] **Speaker**: amazing repetition of the uh that's the
repeating 
[04:08:43] **Speaker**: it gets more amazing

[04:08:45] **Speaker**: hold on I want you to absorb a lot more

[04:08:47] **Speaker**: things are about to happen this is gonna

[04:08:49] **Speaker**: be hard stuff because that's easy

[04:08:51] **Speaker**: hold on I want you to absorb a lot more

[04:08:53] **Speaker**: things are about to happen this is going

[04:08:54] **Speaker**: to be hard stuff this is that's easy

[04:08:58] **Speaker**: Charlie hold on I need you to
concentrate on this stuff 
[04:09:02] **Speaker**: okay

[04:09:03] **Speaker**: we know that that series is dividing by

[04:09:07] **Speaker**: seven a number by seven

[04:09:09] **Speaker**: now that pattern was nine one two three

[04:09:12] **Speaker**: four five six seven eight nine and see

[04:09:14] **Speaker**: how I did the circle that was our

[04:09:15] **Speaker**: control

[04:09:17] **Speaker**: nine one two three four five I'm gonna

[04:09:20] **Speaker**: make a new Circle a new control remember

[04:09:22] **Speaker**: our coil always lines this way but I

[04:09:25] **Speaker**: said to myself what would it mean if I

[04:09:27] **Speaker**: took the number series that would

[04:09:28] **Speaker**: countered the toroid what what is there

[04:09:31] **Speaker**: any relevance to them so I took from the

[04:09:34] **Speaker**: nine I took nine seven four three eight

[04:09:37] **Speaker**: right here and nine two five six one

[04:09:39] **Speaker**: right here okay so I put nine four seven

[04:09:42] **Speaker**: three eight that way nine two five six

[04:09:44] **Speaker**: one that way see

[04:09:46] **Speaker**: so you've reoriented according here on

[04:09:49] **Speaker**: my tour right here and then I connected

[04:09:51] **Speaker**: the one to the two the doubling circuits

[04:09:53] **Speaker**: the two to the four the four to eight
eight to the seven seven to five and the 
[04:09:56] **Speaker**: five to one I made the doubling circuits

[04:09:57] **Speaker**: and what did it give me the integround

[04:10:00] **Speaker**: except it told me that the integround

[04:10:02] **Speaker**: was not connected at the base the way

[04:10:05] **Speaker**: they standardly do it the three that

[04:10:07] **Speaker**: which I said to myself was too obvious
of a mistake they made yeah but 
[04:10:10] **Speaker**: everybody would have made a triangle

[04:10:11] **Speaker**: it's connected if they're not but

[04:10:13] **Speaker**: they're in different locations now the
numbers are all totally different 
[04:10:16] **Speaker**: locations

[04:10:18] **Speaker**: because I took yeah I I used the toroid

[04:10:21] **Speaker**: for where the numbers go

[04:10:23] **Speaker**: so are you saying the Enneagram is

[04:10:25] **Speaker**: incorrect no well yeah I'm saying when

[04:10:28] **Speaker**: they connected the anagram at the base

[04:10:29] **Speaker**: of the 396 that's incorrect no I'm
saying the integrand really was real but what you 
[04:10:35] **Speaker**: know what you've heard again

[04:10:36] **Speaker**: no no it's the same shape the pattern

[04:10:38] **Speaker**: remember we're only looking at the

[04:10:39] **Speaker**: geometry right oh okay okay and they

[04:10:42] **Speaker**: took a circle of one through nine and so

[04:10:45] **Speaker**: that that circle is a result of dividing

[04:10:47] **Speaker**: by seven God give everyone an example of

[04:10:49] **Speaker**: again of dividing by seven take two

[04:10:51] **Speaker**: divide it by seven you get

[04:10:53] **Speaker**: 0.285714 okay so it's 0.28 what was it

[04:10:58] **Speaker**: three two eight five point two eight

[04:11:01] **Speaker**: five seven one it makes us shape

[04:11:04] **Speaker**: okay so I then took instead of doing a

[04:11:08] **Speaker**: circle of one through nine I made my

[04:11:10] **Speaker**: circle based on the toroid skin

[04:11:11] **Speaker**: backwards which I call the antithesis of

[04:11:14] **Speaker**: the toroid and I Then I then it's

[04:11:18] **Speaker**: connected the numbers of my doubling

[04:11:20] **Speaker**: circuits like I knew to do right which

[04:11:22] **Speaker**: is one two four eight seven five one

[04:11:25] **Speaker**: which makes the underground I found that

[04:11:28] **Speaker**: this this is a real

[04:11:30] **Speaker**: this is a real popular shape I just

[04:11:32] **Speaker**: wanted to show you that it was connected

[04:11:34] **Speaker**: they this is on the pharmacies
throughout the world in front of 
[04:11:37] **Speaker**: buildings

[04:11:39] **Speaker**: it's a hidden Mystic a cultist type
symbol 
[04:11:44] **Speaker**: the one and two are connected and you're

[04:11:48] **Speaker**: no I'm not trying to make dividing by

[04:11:49] **Speaker**: seven in mind right I know I'm trying to

[04:11:52] **Speaker**: show that this that doubling

[04:11:57] **Speaker**: no they're my they're not nine too

[04:12:00] **Speaker**: they're on my nine dividers yeah but we

[04:12:03] **Speaker**: started with too much we said it was

[04:12:04] **Speaker**: seven no we didn't we just divided one

[04:12:07] **Speaker**: by seven yeah okay all I did was take

[04:12:10] **Speaker**: one and divide it by seven

[04:12:12] **Speaker**: and I got that pattern I'll go further

[04:12:15] **Speaker**: what does that pattern mean we have

[04:12:18] **Speaker**: multiples now okay now that pattern no

[04:12:20] **Speaker**: one's ever been able to say they say

[04:12:21] **Speaker**: it's an infinite pattern they don't okay

[04:12:24] **Speaker**: I found that it can huh after repeating

[04:12:26] **Speaker**: decimal enough it's a repeating and I

[04:12:28] **Speaker**: found that repeating decimal speaking

[04:12:30] **Speaker**: can be given a discrete number value of

[04:12:33] **Speaker**: such as the repeating decimal of

[04:12:36] **Speaker**: 0.142857 equals a four wanna see how I
figured it out 
[04:12:41] **Speaker**: that's true

[04:12:42] **Speaker**: so what all those times when you're here

[04:12:50] **Speaker**: you want to see how I figured out yeah

[04:12:51] **Speaker**: but it's also before it can't be adding

[04:12:53] **Speaker**: together because 2 divided by 7 is the

[04:12:56] **Speaker**: same series it just starts at

[04:12:57] **Speaker**: 0.285714. so I did add them together

[04:12:59] **Speaker**: I'll tell you how I did them

[04:13:03] **Speaker**: you ready I knew I took seven divided by

[04:13:06] **Speaker**: seven which was one okay it's really

[04:13:09] **Speaker**: this easy all you have to do is say the

[04:13:11] **Speaker**: third number or the second number before

[04:13:13] **Speaker**: nine is a one here so the second number

[04:13:15] **Speaker**: before nine on its reverse mirror must

[04:13:18] **Speaker**: be an eight so if we divide a number

[04:13:21] **Speaker**: by seven one through nine which is our

[04:13:23] **Speaker**: control if we take seven and divide it

[04:13:25] **Speaker**: by two we get an eighth we also know

[04:13:27] **Speaker**: that eight divided by two is four so if

[04:13:29] **Speaker**: this is a four then this number over

[04:13:31] **Speaker**: here must be a five

[04:13:32] **Speaker**: okay which and then I said well if

[04:13:35] **Speaker**: 0.142857 equals five
I have a one right here on the other 
[04:13:39] **Speaker**: side of decimal that I'm adding to one

[04:13:41] **Speaker**: four two eight five seven so one plus

[04:13:43] **Speaker**: one four two eight seven equals five

[04:13:45] **Speaker**: that would be one plus four it's kind of

[04:13:47] **Speaker**: like weird algebra so I then take one

[04:13:49] **Speaker**: four two eight five seven and say that's

[04:13:51] **Speaker**: an equal to a four up here and sure

[04:13:53] **Speaker**: enough multiples of five the last number

[04:13:55] **Speaker**: will be four five ten fifteen twenty

[04:13:58] **Speaker**: twenty five thirty thirty five forty

[04:14:01] **Speaker**: it's too easy

[04:14:03] **Speaker**: okay so sure enough this is multiples of

[04:14:07] **Speaker**: four and because I did but dividing by
two which is multiples of five one 
[04:14:11] **Speaker**: divided by two is five two divided by

[04:14:12] **Speaker**: five is two divided by two is one how'd

[04:14:15] **Speaker**: you get five again you got seven divided

[04:14:17] **Speaker**: by seven equals one then you said eight

[04:14:20] **Speaker**: divided by seven is

[04:14:22] **Speaker**: um is

[04:14:23] **Speaker**: eight divided by seven was would have to

[04:14:27] **Speaker**: all I did was

[04:14:29] **Speaker**: go divide

[04:14:32] **Speaker**: four where's the multiplication like

[04:14:35] **Speaker**: this oh yeah dividing by two because two

[04:14:37] **Speaker**: and seven are my polar numbers right so

[04:14:39] **Speaker**: I went over here

[04:14:41] **Speaker**: and I knew that um

[04:14:44] **Speaker**: I could divide

[04:14:47] **Speaker**: by two because two and seven are mere

[04:14:49] **Speaker**: opposites

[04:14:51] **Speaker**: okay and would give me the Revere

[04:14:53] **Speaker**: multiple reverse multiplication Series

[04:14:55] **Speaker**: in opposite direction because I don't

[04:14:57] **Speaker**: have a repeating decimal I'm dividing by

[04:14:59] **Speaker**: twos I had 5 10 15 20 which is 5 1 6 2 7

[04:15:03] **Speaker**: 3 8. so I knew that dividing by 7 must

[04:15:06] **Speaker**: be the reverse mirror which is four

[04:15:08] **Speaker**: eight three seven so if I so if I made

[04:15:12] **Speaker**: this a 4 then I make point two eight

[04:15:14] **Speaker**: five seven one four and eight so I go

[04:15:16] **Speaker**: down to over here where it's 0.28714
sure enough I add it with which equals 
[04:15:21] **Speaker**: an eight with one and that equals a nine

[04:15:22] **Speaker**: and it worked there's all different ways

[04:15:24] **Speaker**: you can prove it to be true

[04:15:26] **Speaker**: but it wasn't hard to do

[04:15:30] **Speaker**: Okay so

[04:15:32] **Speaker**: so these patterns all mean something all

[04:15:35] **Speaker**: the stuff's connected anyway I just

[04:15:37] **Speaker**: wanted to show you how do we get on to

[04:15:38] **Speaker**: dividing we got on it by the integrands

[04:15:42] **Speaker**: we got onto it by the shape

[04:15:44] **Speaker**: okay dividing by seven

[04:15:47] **Speaker**: okay I just want to show that I had
cracked the code to the integrand because I like to tie in different things to the torque to the integrand because I like to tie in different 
[04:15:55] **Speaker**: things to the torque

[04:15:57] **Speaker**: I just saw a pattern like that in

[04:16:00] **Speaker**: Celestial influences period

[04:16:03] **Speaker**: Syria Celestial influences are bringing

[04:16:06] **Speaker**: down

[04:16:08] **Speaker**: the old book and it was a

[04:16:11] **Speaker**: theosophistic and he was doing he was

[04:16:14] **Speaker**: taking uh the the circle of nine and

[04:16:17] **Speaker**: putting planets on it and he was putting

[04:16:20] **Speaker**: um he was doing all sorts of macro

[04:16:22] **Speaker**: overlays

[04:16:25] **Speaker**: the same thing

[04:16:26] **Speaker**: okay Charlie we're going to start with

[04:16:28] **Speaker**: you microcosmic overlays that's exactly

[04:16:30] **Speaker**: what we're just doing now

[04:16:32] **Speaker**: you were doing that too

[04:16:34] **Speaker**: but nobody does it with the decimal

[04:16:36] **Speaker**: system he didn't have it connected the

[04:16:37] **Speaker**: same way nobody has it connected to

[04:16:39] **Speaker**: numbers

[04:16:41] **Speaker**: that's the trick bringing numbers in

[04:16:43] **Speaker**: geometry and surface topology and

[04:16:46] **Speaker**: particle physics and

[04:16:49] **Speaker**: spirit and biologics everything together

[04:16:51] **Speaker**: in computers now who would let's start

[04:16:54] **Speaker**: with the remaining time we have can can

[04:16:57] **Speaker**: we interview each person

[04:17:01] **Speaker**: we don't have much time to two minutes I

[04:17:03] **Speaker**: should have given you guys a long time

[04:17:05] **Speaker**: ago because how much let's see any

[04:17:08] **Speaker**: comments that everybody has on this that

[04:17:11] **Speaker**: you uh

[04:17:13] **Speaker**: I guess take the camera off me

[04:17:15] **Speaker**: and we'll start with uh somebody

[04:17:19] **Speaker**: okay any volunteers

[04:17:22] **Speaker**: hmm

[04:17:24] **Speaker**: give comments on what you understand or

[04:17:25] **Speaker**: what you've seen or how just so that

[04:17:27] **Speaker**: anything you want to say I guess to your

[04:17:29] **Speaker**: relatives back in our Alpha Sanctuary

[04:17:32] **Speaker**: you know we're going to go ahead

[04:17:45] **Speaker**: Charlie said what get with each other

[04:17:49] **Speaker**: yeah but a long strange trip has been

[04:17:52] **Speaker**: alive for me to assimilate everything

[04:17:56] **Speaker**: but

[04:17:58] **Speaker**: extremely really intriguing

[04:18:04] **Speaker**: yeah this has so much richness to it
clearly 
[04:18:12] **Speaker**: you know you know your comments because

[04:18:14] **Speaker**: they're not to me but to the people who

[04:18:16] **Speaker**: are going to be in the in the acetate

[04:18:19] **Speaker**: world of the film mostly talk about the

[04:18:21] **Speaker**: kids I teach every day have to be

[04:18:23] **Speaker**: subjected to the technology of math

[04:18:25] **Speaker**: which is so boring science and I and I

[04:18:28] **Speaker**: can try to make it interesting and to

[04:18:30] **Speaker**: some it's interesting but the real

[04:18:33] **Speaker**: interesting math that I've taught this

[04:18:35] **Speaker**: year has been in dynamical systems about

[04:18:37] **Speaker**: those chaos because it's so

[04:18:39] **Speaker**: philosophically relevant to them and

[04:18:40] **Speaker**: that's what they want and this has that

[04:18:43] **Speaker**: same kind of richness that they don't

[04:18:45] **Speaker**: get in mathematics

[04:18:46] **Speaker**: because where we have a mathematics

[04:18:49] **Speaker**: that's driven by science and technology

[04:18:52] **Speaker**: that is an established magic so to speak

[04:18:56] **Speaker**: of from the 16th to the 20th century and

[04:18:59] **Speaker**: this sort of stuff is usually taught

[04:19:02] **Speaker**: through college mathematics Majors not

[04:19:04] **Speaker**: stuff like this uh would be about

[04:19:06] **Speaker**: college math Majors but they would have

[04:19:08] **Speaker**: to do it in a way they even make that

[04:19:10] **Speaker**: voice but it's a numbers there is very

[04:19:13] **Speaker**: interesting except it isolates itself

[04:19:15] **Speaker**: it's usually in the universities it does

[04:19:17] **Speaker**: never have any

[04:19:18] **Speaker**: connection to real world sorts of things

[04:19:21] **Speaker**: and this stuff you can see the layers

[04:19:23] **Speaker**: for me and like a good metaphor in

[04:19:26] **Speaker**: poetry is just all the stuff that's

[04:19:28] **Speaker**: there and it hangs together in a
cohesive 
[04:19:33] **Speaker**: and you can do it at different levels

[04:19:36] **Speaker**: that's why it's rich

[04:19:42] **Speaker**: it's what I want to do is hear a

[04:19:43] **Speaker**: response

[04:19:45] **Speaker**: um I guess so

[04:19:52] **Speaker**: are you going to continue with this
yeah 
[04:19:59] **Speaker**: yeah because I mean this could just he's

[04:20:03] **Speaker**: gonna make someone

[04:20:05] **Speaker**: is having a bad day I feel great

[04:20:09] **Speaker**: you know that's kind of it it is because

[04:20:13] **Speaker**: when you think about it it's like

[04:20:14] **Speaker**: everything that you've explained to us

[04:20:17] **Speaker**: gives meaning for our lives for for us

[04:20:22] **Speaker**: as individuals for everything that we

[04:20:24] **Speaker**: see that everything that we do it just

[04:20:26] **Speaker**: it all comes back to the cycle the flow

[04:20:29] **Speaker**: and it just makes it so real you know

[04:20:33] **Speaker**: it's like I'm just happy that I was here

[04:20:35] **Speaker**: and I was supposed to have a huge party

[04:20:37] **Speaker**: today and it got all rained out and then

[04:20:40] **Speaker**: you know what I mean so it's like thank

[04:20:43] **Speaker**: God I was here I told you it was a

[04:20:45] **Speaker**: blessing it was

[04:20:47] **Speaker**: your birthday Thursday

[04:21:00] **Speaker**: you can't explain it to people you know

[04:21:03] **Speaker**: you know plus

[04:21:04] **Speaker**: the concept of the the flowing that you

[04:21:07] **Speaker**: were showing us you know the very basic

[04:21:09] **Speaker**: beginning and to me that was the most

[04:21:13] **Speaker**: important thing is because it just

[04:21:16] **Speaker**: showed how everything is connected and

[04:21:18] **Speaker**: it proves it you know what I mean

[04:21:20] **Speaker**: just proves it

[04:21:22] **Speaker**: yeah there's no point in Warren when
you're all connected 
[04:21:33] **Speaker**: at home even though I don't even pretend

[04:21:35] **Speaker**: to understand

[04:21:38] **Speaker**: but innately I I own it as soon as I see

[04:21:42] **Speaker**: it and I see the pattern that
um 
[04:21:47] **Speaker**: it just like starts to to you know fit

[04:21:52] **Speaker**: in all the right places and

[04:21:55] **Speaker**: um I believe that we're all born with

[04:21:58] **Speaker**: that goal that that drive to to go home

[04:22:02] **Speaker**: with to whatever this knowledge is

[04:22:05] **Speaker**: to know truly know God the name of God

[04:22:08] **Speaker**: the love of God and to relate that to
everything we do and 
[04:22:13] **Speaker**: and that it's

[04:22:15] **Speaker**: out of that gift of

[04:22:17] **Speaker**: from God to us we have everything

[04:22:20] **Speaker**: nothing's been limited nothing's been

[04:22:23] **Speaker**: kept from

[04:22:25] **Speaker**: uh from us in any way

[04:22:27] **Speaker**: that the whole universe is out there as

[04:22:31] **Speaker**: a gift in every aspect

[04:22:34] **Speaker**: that a human could conceive I give

[04:22:36] **Speaker**: everybody as a free present these books

[04:22:39] **Speaker**: they're they're mystical you know and

[04:22:41] **Speaker**: you can't tell I got the map

[04:22:43] **Speaker**: there
yes 
[04:23:25] **Speaker**: my thing is that you know I make that

[04:23:28] **Speaker**: sound because me and Charlie were

[04:23:29] **Speaker**: talking about we're all been doing it I

[04:23:32] **Speaker**: just you know

[04:23:33] **Speaker**: so I I wasn't my fear I didn't have any

[04:23:35] **Speaker**: fear though you know what's so strange

[04:23:38] **Speaker**: is that you're telling us about all this

[04:23:41] **Speaker**: and how this is going to finally work

[04:23:43] **Speaker**: when it

[04:23:45] **Speaker**: when the when does the energy in this

[04:23:49] **Speaker**: way gets invented the way it's supposed

[04:23:50] **Speaker**: to happen and eliminates petroleum stuff

[04:23:54] **Speaker**: and all that and you're wondering how
you're going to get the money for a 
[04:23:58] **Speaker**: whiteboard or whatever and it's just

[04:24:00] **Speaker**: like it just blows my mind that's like

[04:24:03] **Speaker**: and you don't have to worry about that

[04:24:05] **Speaker**: because it's all just gonna come

[04:24:07] **Speaker**: because you can't contain this now like

[04:24:09] **Speaker**: you've you've told too many people

[04:24:13] **Speaker**: yeah it does it does I told the people

[04:24:17] **Speaker**: when I was a little kid yeah it takes 25

[04:24:20] **Speaker**: years to become an overnight success oh

[04:24:22] **Speaker**: yeah and yeah it's all moving at the
right speech 
[04:24:29] **Speaker**: every will of God that these things

[04:24:31] **Speaker**: shall come to pass and that we don't

[04:24:33] **Speaker**: really have a choice

[04:24:35] **Speaker**: that the kingdom of God is going to be

[04:24:37] **Speaker**: created whether we want it or not

[04:24:38] **Speaker**: individually

[04:24:40] **Speaker**: and this will be used because it's in

[04:24:43] **Speaker**: harmony with the vibration of the Lord
so 
[04:24:51] **Speaker**: foundation for you know building the

[04:24:54] **Speaker**: whole new Society

[04:24:56] **Speaker**: and he gave us the key which is nice if

[04:24:59] **Speaker**: you think about all the billions of
people 
[04:25:04] **Speaker**: live by an oil reaction how many whales

[04:25:07] **Speaker**: will spoiled to the right

[04:25:12] **Speaker**: it can easily vanish again

[04:25:15] **Speaker**: really cakes

[04:25:17] **Speaker**: and travel incredible amount of effort
to keep it alive 
[04:25:23] **Speaker**: don't you think this kind of stuff has

[04:25:25] **Speaker**: been

[04:25:26] **Speaker**: done before or you know like I mean as

[04:25:31] **Speaker**: you talk about the concept of circle

[04:25:33] **Speaker**: don't you think

[04:25:35] **Speaker**: that never did it in The Lion King

[04:25:41] **Speaker**: I mean you know the somebody in the past

[04:25:44] **Speaker**: must have done something similar to this

[04:25:48] **Speaker**: nature and it got similar they did it

[04:25:50] **Speaker**: yeah it got vanished and then I'm just

[04:25:52] **Speaker**: I'm just picking up the clues at the
same 
[04:25:58] **Speaker**: but at least you know the great thing

[04:26:01] **Speaker**: about your work is at least your

[04:26:03] **Speaker**: seeing the up to until now you know the

[04:26:07] **Speaker**: mysticism was like

[04:26:08] **Speaker**: totally detached you know from ordinary

[04:26:13] **Speaker**: masses you know but now you are

[04:26:15] **Speaker**: combining those two things together you

[04:26:18] **Speaker**: know and making it known to people you

[04:26:22] **Speaker**: know which is

[04:26:24] **Speaker**: really grounding like a whispered to you
earlier 
[04:26:28] **Speaker**: in this

[04:26:30] **Speaker**: because we're smart

[04:26:37] **Speaker**: um

[04:26:39] **Speaker**: well just in this um day and age there's

[04:26:42] **Speaker**: a growing movements that people can see

[04:26:45] **Speaker**: to interweave science and spirituality

[04:26:48] **Speaker**: and it's due to the fact that due to The

[04:26:53] **Speaker**: Duality there's

[04:26:55] **Speaker**: um in this Gap ecological sociological

[04:26:58] **Speaker**: crisis is that um have escalated because

[04:27:01] **Speaker**: of

[04:27:02] **Speaker**: um the you know misguided calendar the

[04:27:05] **Speaker**: misguided you know mathematical

[04:27:07] **Speaker**: numerological astrological systems and

[04:27:10] **Speaker**: so what this is focalizing is especially

[04:27:13] **Speaker**: because the Baha'i faith is a faith that

[04:27:15] **Speaker**: uh is you know not a particular Faith

[04:27:18] **Speaker**: it's a whole Faith it's something that

[04:27:20] **Speaker**: incorporates the teachings of all the

[04:27:22] **Speaker**: religions so what this uh that you're

[04:27:27] **Speaker**: sharing today is doing is very clearly

[04:27:30] **Speaker**: and concisely bridging that Gap and

[04:27:33] **Speaker**: in that fulcrum point which is you know

[04:27:35] **Speaker**: where the nine is is

[04:27:38] **Speaker**: the energy that you're asking us to

[04:27:41] **Speaker**: here's here's this gift go and take this

[04:27:43] **Speaker**: and apply this in whatever way you can

[04:27:46] **Speaker**: whatever way God calls you to share this

[04:27:48] **Speaker**: with because it's basically the science

[04:27:51] **Speaker**: of the the holy name and it comes

[04:27:54] **Speaker**: through in all creation and you're

[04:27:58] **Speaker**: giving us the formula for what we

[04:28:01] **Speaker**: already know what already exists so that

[04:28:05] **Speaker**: we can you know take the seed and sew it

[04:28:20] **Speaker**: the real objective
is 
[04:28:26] **Speaker**: for that

[04:28:27] **Speaker**: to get the next meeting

[04:28:33] **Speaker**: that you will be able to function

[04:28:41] **Speaker**: you understand how powerful and

[04:28:43] **Speaker**: important the Helena of God is you've

[04:28:45] **Speaker**: said that yourself

[04:28:47] **Speaker**: and
um and um 
[04:28:54] **Speaker**: and the thing is in this world we use

[04:28:56] **Speaker**: our feet to get around

[04:28:58] **Speaker**: okay but in the next World we're going

[04:29:02] **Speaker**: to be crippled unless we know how to

[04:29:05] **Speaker**: breathe and intonate

[04:29:08] **Speaker**: that holy name of God

[04:29:10] **Speaker**: okay because in the next world that will

[04:29:14] **Speaker**: totally give us the wings to our soul

[04:29:17] **Speaker**: and give us free flight

[04:29:20] **Speaker**: okay even in this world as well too all

[04:29:23] **Speaker**: our psychic States paranormal States we

[04:29:25] **Speaker**: should never ever sell ourselves short

[04:29:27] **Speaker**: from what for one altered state

[04:29:30] **Speaker**: we should always know that we should be

[04:29:31] **Speaker**: totally integrated if we if there's if

[04:29:33] **Speaker**: we should have psychicness or telepathy

[04:29:36] **Speaker**: or levitation or anything we should ever

[04:29:38] **Speaker**: have they must all be integrated in

[04:29:41] **Speaker**: balance and in harmony

[04:29:43] **Speaker**: and the name of God

[04:29:45] **Speaker**: balances all those abilities all of us

[04:29:47] **Speaker**: have unique traits and skills some are

[04:29:49] **Speaker**: psychics some are great in math some are

[04:29:52] **Speaker**: great in writing some are great in art

[04:29:55] **Speaker**: but when we take all these aspects of

[04:29:58] **Speaker**: our brain

[04:29:59] **Speaker**: okay by the name of God it makes all

[04:30:02] **Speaker**: these parts of our brains working

[04:30:03] **Speaker**: together where one part does an atrophy

[04:30:06] **Speaker**: and another over accentuate

[04:30:09] **Speaker**: and that's what the Holy Name Of God

[04:30:11] **Speaker**: does it makes all the parts of your

[04:30:13] **Speaker**: brain

[04:30:16] **Speaker**: work together function well as one

[04:30:19] **Speaker**: instead of teaching those children to

[04:30:21] **Speaker**: teach each separate letter that's not

[04:30:23] **Speaker**: the way they should do it because they
should teach them to to know the name of 
[04:30:27] **Speaker**: God

[04:30:28] **Speaker**: and that's how you then tap into what

[04:30:32] **Speaker**: the real meaning of a human being is

[04:30:34] **Speaker**: the human being that is a

[04:30:37] **Speaker**: is a hologram is a paradigm

[04:30:42] **Speaker**: of God we actually reveal God's Bounty

[04:30:46] **Speaker**: his grace

[04:30:47] **Speaker**: to how we release that spirit in us we

[04:30:51] **Speaker**: are actually the revelation of God

[04:30:53] **Speaker**: we are asked to Creation to the rest of

[04:30:56] **Speaker**: the world so it wasn't for us all the

[04:30:58] **Speaker**: most beautiful and coming names all the

[04:31:00] **Speaker**: attributes and qualities of God would

[04:31:02] **Speaker**: not be revealed

[04:31:04] **Speaker**: and God God's Own image would be not

[04:31:09] **Speaker**: not re-re not

[04:31:14] **Speaker**: not distributed

[04:31:16] **Speaker**: throughout the Universe

[04:31:18] **Speaker**: hmm

[04:31:20] **Speaker**: not reflected throughout the Universe
thanks 
[04:31:25] **Speaker**: about this quality if it doesn't have

[04:31:28] **Speaker**: any resistance white only produces twice

[04:31:32] **Speaker**: as my job energy

[04:31:34] **Speaker**: it's it's much more the reason is

[04:31:36] **Speaker**: they're making out a filament Strand and

[04:31:38] **Speaker**: it's enslaved they're not doing it

[04:31:39] **Speaker**: correctly the next coils are supposed to

[04:31:41] **Speaker**: be made out of glass but it's very

[04:31:44] **Speaker**: difficult for us to make and we're

[04:31:45] **Speaker**: struggling and it's expensive and I've

[04:31:47] **Speaker**: met with people to make them already but

[04:31:49] **Speaker**: they already tell me that it costs money

[04:31:51] **Speaker**: to experiment so this is a very slow

[04:31:53] **Speaker**: process I'm going through we're looking

[04:31:55] **Speaker**: at months again or years before I get

[04:31:58] **Speaker**: this off the ground depending if you

[04:32:00] **Speaker**: need some more investors I know a couple
millionaires 
[04:32:05] **Speaker**: um

[04:32:05] **Speaker**: yeah I don't need the money but the

[04:32:09] **Speaker**: people who make this or I'm going

[04:32:10] **Speaker**: through we're looking at months again or

[04:32:12] **Speaker**: years before I get this off the ground
depending 
[04:32:20] **Speaker**: um

[04:32:21] **Speaker**: yeah I don't need the money but the

[04:32:24] **Speaker**: people who make this there are real

[04:32:26] **Speaker**: bills that they won't work for free I if

[04:32:28] **Speaker**: we can't find people who who

[04:32:31] **Speaker**: will donate their engineering skills if

[04:32:34] **Speaker**: we don't know engineers and talented

[04:32:36] **Speaker**: people then we have to hire people but

[04:32:39] **Speaker**: my first goal was for everybody just to

[04:32:41] **Speaker**: to contribute what their skill is

[04:32:44] **Speaker**: I've done it so far based on the no

[04:32:48] **Speaker**: strings attached free

[04:32:50] **Speaker**: gift you know participation type

[04:32:52] **Speaker**: situation if there's any investors that

[04:32:54] **Speaker**: want to I don't beg I don't solicit for

[04:32:57] **Speaker**: money at these talks and I always

[04:32:58] **Speaker**: continue to teach for free but

[04:33:02] **Speaker**: um as long as they're not into it from

[04:33:05] **Speaker**: the fact of return let me put it this

[04:33:07] **Speaker**: way to keep them from being greedy about

[04:33:09] **Speaker**: it

[04:33:10] **Speaker**: I won't promise them any money in return

[04:33:13] **Speaker**: for whatever they invest I won't make

[04:33:15] **Speaker**: any I won't try and lure them or entice

[04:33:18] **Speaker**: them

[04:33:19] **Speaker**: if they want to make it without me they

[04:33:21] **Speaker**: can get my book it cost me forty dollars

[04:33:23] **Speaker**: to print this book and they can make it

[04:33:26] **Speaker**: on their own and they can even omit me

[04:33:29] **Speaker**: okay if that's their desire

[04:33:33] **Speaker**: but but if they want to see it made

[04:33:36] **Speaker**: with my resources and my skill then this

[04:33:40] **Speaker**: is what the book looks like it's a big

[04:33:42] **Speaker**: thing

[04:33:44] **Speaker**: um

[04:33:46] **Speaker**: then yeah I would definitely know where

[04:33:49] **Speaker**: the money is most appropriately used you

[04:33:51] **Speaker**: know because all the people that I work

[04:33:53] **Speaker**: with are are very talented very skilled

[04:33:56] **Speaker**: I'd also would compensate certain

[04:33:57] **Speaker**: writers certain artists I would actually

[04:34:00] **Speaker**: compensate Charlie and Judy because

[04:34:03] **Speaker**: they're teachers I would actually offer

[04:34:05] **Speaker**: them a publishing agreement because I

[04:34:08] **Speaker**: have a publisher but he just wants the

[04:34:09] **Speaker**: draft the final product I have a CD-ROM

[04:34:12] **Speaker**: company and I would actually ask them to

[04:34:14] **Speaker**: produce teaching materials for schools

[04:34:15] **Speaker**: so the you guys are the guys I'd use the

[04:34:18] **Speaker**: money before I'd pay you guys to do the

[04:34:20] **Speaker**: work

[04:34:21] **Speaker**: so

[04:34:24] **Speaker**: you know me I can live on without money

[04:34:27] **Speaker**: I'm okay
you know 
[04:34:30] **Speaker**: because

[04:34:32] **Speaker**: I bought a new tent

[04:34:35] **Speaker**: s it's good yeah
but I'm gonna go to Kmart and get 
[04:34:40] **Speaker**: another one too

[04:34:41] **Speaker**: so I have two that way I'm expanding
