[00:00:00] **Randy Powell**: One principle you should remember in this math is that whatever is going on in this higher world,

[00:00:06] **Randy Powell**: represented by my 9, 3, and 6, this higher trinity here, is mirrored in the lower world.

[00:00:12] **Randy Powell**: But it's kind of in a, when we say mirror again, we mean it's kind of in a reverse direction or a mirror flow.

[00:00:21] **Randy Powell**: So to me, when I think of this, when the higher world is dividing itself, this world, this physical world, is multiplying.

[00:00:29] **Randy Powell**: And those two functions are very interrelated. So let's look at division.

[00:00:35] **Randy Powell**: Now first I want to start with the numbers we have in the physical world of creation, which are only six numbers.

[00:00:41] **Randy Powell**: One, two, four, eight, seven, and five. Those are the only six numbers which physically exist in the world of creation.

[00:00:54] **Randy Powell**: And they form the underlying geometry of creation, which is essentially hexagonal.

[00:01:02] **Randy Powell**: One of the most prevalent common forms seen in nature, the hexagon, whether it's the polarization of light, which can be modeled in this mathematics,

[00:01:10] **Randy Powell**: whether it is the polarization seen in crystals or snowflakes.

[00:01:17] **Randy Powell**: Every snowflake, even though they're all said to be unique, is basically a hexagon.

[00:01:23] **Randy Powell**: So these six numbers form this hexagonal underpinning geometry of the physical world.

[00:01:32] **Randy Powell**: Well, we saw what happens when we multiply them in four mirror images.

[00:01:36] **Randy Powell**: When you divide them, they actually do the same pattern.

[00:01:41] **Randy Powell**: But there's a simple rule, and I have to show you another principle before I can explain that rule to you.

[00:01:48] **Randy Powell**: And so we looked at doubling the next principle I like to show before we do division, is something called reciprocals, very well known concept and math,

[00:01:58] **Randy Powell**: hugely significant concept when it comes to physics, hugely significant function of math, reciprocals.

[00:02:08] **Randy Powell**: So how do we model reciprocals here?

[00:02:12] **Randy Powell**: I want you to notice, first of all, my nine here splitting into these three and six, it's highly significant to this symbol.

[00:02:19] **Randy Powell**: First of all, if I take my one to my two, notice that the angle of the nine to the three, one plus two is three.

[00:02:28] **Randy Powell**: If I at nine plus three is three, by the way, eight plus four, which is at the same parallel angle, is twelve, which is three.

[00:02:37] **Randy Powell**: Seven plus five is twelve, which is three. Six plus six, where we end here, is twelve, which is three.

[00:02:45] **Randy Powell**: All of those at the angle of this, my three, which is my field.

[00:02:50] **Randy Powell**: This field is separating out. We call it a flux field.

[00:02:56] **Randy Powell**: You could think of it, the closest thing known to it is a magnetic field. It is just spreading everything out.

[00:03:04] **Randy Powell**: So I have three going this way in parallel lines.

[00:03:08] **Randy Powell**: I have six going the other way. Eight plus seven is fifteen, which is six. Nine plus six is fifteen, which is six.

[00:03:18] **Randy Powell**: One plus five is six, two plus four is six, three plus three is six.

[00:03:24] **Randy Powell**: Everything moving at this angle is six. So when I follow this symbol, I'm really going three, six, three, six, three, six.

[00:03:31] **Randy Powell**: I'm showing that oscillation underlying this process of doubling.

[00:03:38] **Randy Powell**: All right?

[00:03:41] **Randy Powell**: So if I take my one now, I know if I go one times one is one.

[00:03:50] **Randy Powell**: Let me move from here. One direction going each way. I get to five and two.

[00:03:59] **Randy Powell**: Very significant when we actually learn about the original equation of this, which was composed of one, two, five, and one.

[00:04:06] **Randy Powell**: But we won't go into that now. Two times five is ten. One plus zero comes back to one.

[00:04:14] **Randy Powell**: Let's go another one. Four, seven. Seven times four is twenty-eight, which equals back to ten, which equals one.

[00:04:25] **Randy Powell**: If I go up again, I get to eight times eight, which is sixty-four, which comes back to one.

[00:04:31] **Randy Powell**: Now if I switch, I'm just going to go back to the same number, seven and four, two and five, and then they're going to come back to one.

[00:04:40] **Randy Powell**: What I'm showing here is called reciprocals. All right? They're always separated in a certain way, and they always come back to the number from which they started.

[00:04:52] **Randy Powell**: So if one times one equals one, every direction I go, two times five is one, seven times four is one, eight times eight is one.

[00:05:00] **Randy Powell**: They're forming reciprocals that always come back to one. It's very important in modeling sound, because this is the way we're going to model reciprocal motion, or something which we call shearing.

[00:05:13] **Randy Powell**: All right? But just so we don't lose you, let's look at that in terms of another number. Let's take two.

[00:05:20] **Randy Powell**: Two times two is four. Four times one is four. They all come here, and here eight times five is forty. Four plus zero is four. Seven times seven is forty-nine, nine plus four is four.

[00:05:39] **Randy Powell**: So no matter which way I come here, they always reduce back to my original product, which was four. How about four? Four times four.

[00:05:51] **Randy Powell**: And I'll explain to you why I'm saying one times one, two times two, four times four. It's because there's actually an energy coming out here, which is activating these numbers, giving them functions.

[00:06:02] **Randy Powell**: In this system, whereas in regular conventional math, the functions are held still in the center of your equation, and the numbers move around.

[00:06:11] **Randy Powell**: In this math, the numbers are still, we could call them stationary vector interstities. The numbers are still, but the functions move, which is more like reality when we see functions are actually abilities, capabilities, and they are modeling motion.

[00:06:31] **Randy Powell**: But back to what I was saying, four times four is sixteen. Six plus one is seven.

[00:06:40] **Randy Powell**: I'm going to go here two times eight is sixteen. Again, back to seven. One times seven is seven. Five times five is twenty-five, which is seven.

[00:06:53] **Randy Powell**: You can do that for any number. I'll just do them quickly. Eight times eight, sixty-four comes back to one. Seven and four is twenty-eight, back to one. Two and five is ten is one. One and one is one. Seven times seven is forty-nine, which is four. Eight times five is forty is four. Four times one is four. Two times two is four.

[00:07:13] **Randy Powell**: Five times five is twenty-five, which is seven. Seven times one is seven. Eight times two is sixteen, which is seven. Four times four is sixteen, which is seven.

[00:07:24] **Randy Powell**: These are called reciprocals. We're just going to start with one is my control. If I'm talking about a system where one is my control, then my reciprocals are going to be two and five, seven and four, eight and eight.

[00:07:40] **Randy Powell**: Now, the reason why I explained all that, I said we were going to talk about division. We talked about multiplication. We understood that. What does it create? It creates doubling, creates halfing, it creates mirror imaging. We get polarity, which we haven't fully explained.

[00:07:56] **Randy Powell**: We get all these properties from multiplication. We'll have out division.

[00:08:02] **Randy Powell**: Dividing by any number, here's a principle for you to write down. Dividing by any number is exactly the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

[00:08:16] **Randy Powell**: In other words, if I am multiplying, let's say, we could say by one. If I'm multiplying by one, I'm going to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Just like I showed here, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

[00:08:40] **Randy Powell**: How about if I'm dividing by one? We'll see this same kind of thing. One divided by one is one. Let me just reuse that because I have it all written down and make it go faster.

[00:09:02] **Randy Powell**: One, I should be saying dividing by one. One divided by one is one. Two divided by one is two. Three divided by one is three. Four divided by one is four. Five divided by one is five. You get the point. Six divided by one is six. Seven divided by one is seven. Eight divided by one is eight. Nine divided by one is nine.

[00:09:30] **Randy Powell**: Where is my multiple? Because one and one is its own reciprocal here. In this system, when one is my control, I said one times one is one. You have two times five is one. Seven times four is one. Eight times eight is one. One is eight is its own reciprocal.

[00:09:47] **Randy Powell**: So if I'm multiplying by one, when I divide by one, I'm going to get the same thing. When I multiply by one, I get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. When I divide by one, I get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
