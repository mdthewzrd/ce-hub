[00:00:00] **Randy Powell**: 100% goodness, divinity, if you will.

[00:00:04] **Randy Powell**: 100% positive energy.

[00:00:07] **Randy Powell**: What we experience as negative is a result of that energy moving into this world, creating

[00:00:14] **Randy Powell**: a backdrop, if you will, mirror imaging.

[00:00:18] **Randy Powell**: Alright, so multiplication tables are straight lines or they're circles.

[00:00:23] **Randy Powell**: Now that creates, notice my doubling never breaks.

[00:00:27] **Randy Powell**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5.

[00:00:30] **Randy Powell**: Let's go out one more.

[00:00:32] **Randy Powell**: 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1.

[00:00:36] **Randy Powell**: Right?

[00:00:37] **Randy Powell**: 4, 8, 7, 5, 1, 2.

[00:00:44] **Randy Powell**: They're changing position even though they're really now.

[00:00:46] **Randy Powell**: I'm just looking at different controls.

[00:00:48] **Randy Powell**: But my doubling circuits are always in a one way flow.

[00:00:52] **Randy Powell**: They're always moving like this.

[00:00:54] **Randy Powell**: It doesn't matter where I start, even if I start with my 1, here I'm going 1, 2, 4,

[00:01:00] **Randy Powell**: 8, 7, 5.

[00:01:02] **Randy Powell**: It's never breaks this one way flow.

[00:01:07] **Randy Powell**: Even though this energy, I say, it moves omnidirectionally.

[00:01:12] **Randy Powell**: In other words, it comes from the center of everything out, from the center of every

[00:01:17] **Randy Powell**: atom, from the center of the earth, from the center of a solar system.

[00:01:21] **Randy Powell**: Any body of mass, any body of mass and equilibrium has this energy coming out of its center and

[00:01:29] **Randy Powell**: synchronizing everything that's connected to its body.

[00:01:33] **Randy Powell**: Alright?

[00:01:34] **Randy Powell**: The earth could be an example of that.

[00:01:38] **Randy Powell**: So as this energy comes out in all directions, it's pulsing everything forward.

[00:01:43] **Randy Powell**: It's also causing disintegration.

[00:01:46] **Randy Powell**: What you could observe in some cases is radioactive decay, which is based on doubling our half-life.

[00:01:54] **Randy Powell**: It's why everything, this is why we always have to eat to stay alive because it's a

[00:02:00] **Randy Powell**: systemic living system.

[00:02:02] **Randy Powell**: It can never, the last thing you want it to do is to back up.

[00:02:07] **Randy Powell**: Backing up is the equivalent of death.

[00:02:11] **Randy Powell**: It puts an end to the positive flow.

[00:02:14] **Randy Powell**: So let me show you in my book here, again, I'm sorry for these poor illustrations, just

[00:02:19] **Randy Powell**: finally what we have here and what I'm trying to explain to you and show you in the symbol.

[00:02:25] **Randy Powell**: And then we're going to move to a better, more dimensionalized model.

[00:02:30] **Randy Powell**: Okay?

[00:02:31] **Randy Powell**: So just a few things, final things we could explain.

[00:02:35] **Randy Powell**: Here I'm showing controls.

[00:02:37] **Randy Powell**: Okay?

[00:02:38] **Randy Powell**: So this is what I was just explaining.

[00:02:40] **Randy Powell**: My first one is multiples of one.

[00:02:42] **Randy Powell**: So I have my nine, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

[00:02:45] **Randy Powell**: The same thing you're seeing on the symbol up there.

[00:02:48] **Randy Powell**: I could just as easily do a control of two, two, four, six, eight, one, three, five, seven,

[00:02:54] **Randy Powell**: nine.

[00:02:55] **Randy Powell**: Notice my doubling circuits never break.

[00:02:57] **Randy Powell**: I said, one, two, four, eight, seven, five, moving in the same direction.

[00:03:02] **Randy Powell**: All right?

[00:03:05] **Randy Powell**: I could have four, eight, three, seven, two, six, one, five, nine.

[00:03:10] **Randy Powell**: Examples of four, still my doubling circuits, one, two, four, eight, seven, five, still

[00:03:15] **Randy Powell**: moving in the same direction.

[00:03:18] **Randy Powell**: I could do eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, nine, still one, two, four, eight,

[00:03:23] **Randy Powell**: seven, five, one, two, always moving in the same positive flow direction.

[00:03:29] **Randy Powell**: All right?

[00:03:32] **Randy Powell**: These are examples of what I mean when I say you can't move it in the other way.

[00:03:37] **Randy Powell**: Because if I do, I never get my multiplication tables.

[00:03:40] **Randy Powell**: Look here.

[00:03:41] **Randy Powell**: Here I would have it instead of going in this positive flow, I'd be going backwards, one,

[00:03:46] **Randy Powell**: two, four, eight, seven, five.

[00:03:48] **Randy Powell**: What's to have a doubling circuit?

[00:03:50] **Randy Powell**: I still even have my numbers equally in my field.

[00:03:53] **Randy Powell**: I still have my polar number pairs, but what's the problem?

[00:03:57] **Randy Powell**: I even still could model my family number groups.

[00:04:00] **Randy Powell**: But if you go around the perimeter of the circle, I no longer have a valid multiplication

[00:04:06] **Randy Powell**: series.

[00:04:07] **Randy Powell**: This is not any of the multiplication series.

[00:04:11] **Randy Powell**: This is just another example of one that wouldn't work.

[00:04:15] **Randy Powell**: Even though they're equally in the field and everything is, I still have no multiplication

[00:04:19] **Randy Powell**: series around my circle.

[00:04:21] **Randy Powell**: So you must account for every single principle in the circle.

[00:04:25] **Randy Powell**: Let's see what else I have here.

[00:04:28] **Randy Powell**: Because this is what it's doing.

[00:04:30] **Randy Powell**: And I'm going to show you this in the numbers.

[00:04:32] **Randy Powell**: Only this right here is how these numbers are modeling motion.

[00:04:37] **Randy Powell**: It's something coming in at the top.

[00:04:39] **Randy Powell**: It's inverting, shooting out at the bottom, coming back around in a living, stomach, vortex.

[00:04:46] **Randy Powell**: Okay.

[00:04:48] **Randy Powell**: All right.

[00:04:53] **Randy Powell**: So again, it's modeling this motion out at the bottom, in at the top, inverting, just

[00:04:59] **Randy Powell**: like this.

[00:05:01] **Randy Powell**: It is, let me show you how that occurs in the numbers.

[00:05:09] **Randy Powell**: Because all this is is a perfect waveform.

[00:05:14] **Randy Powell**: Anytime you have a waveform, you're going to have nodal points, crests, dips, okay,

[00:05:20] **Randy Powell**: hills and valleys, curves and curls.

[00:05:23] **Randy Powell**: And anytime you have nodal points, you got a number.

[00:05:28] **Randy Powell**: So every time you have a crest in your wave, you've got a number.

[00:05:32] **Randy Powell**: All right.

[00:05:33] **Randy Powell**: And that's what these numbers really are.

[00:05:34] **Randy Powell**: Again, you can call them stationary vector interstities if you want to give it a

[00:05:40] **Randy Powell**: pompous sound name or a high, a high science word.

[00:05:46] **Randy Powell**: Okay.

[00:05:47] **Randy Powell**: Let's look at how these numbers are making a vortex really quick.

[00:05:51] **Randy Powell**: So here on my first stage, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, what's going to happen in my

[00:05:55] **Randy Powell**: second stage, when you notice my 2 just goes up.

[00:05:58] **Randy Powell**: My 7, it just goes up.

[00:06:01] **Randy Powell**: In fact, my 4 just goes up.

[00:06:03] **Randy Powell**: 4 goes up here, next to 2.

[00:06:05] **Randy Powell**: My 5 goes straight up, next to 5.

[00:06:07] **Randy Powell**: But what happens to my 8 and 1?

[00:06:09] **Randy Powell**: Well, if you look, my 8 ends up over here.

[00:06:11] **Randy Powell**: My 1 ends up over here.

[00:06:14] **Randy Powell**: Because what happened is they actually inverted.

[00:06:17] **Randy Powell**: All right.

[00:06:19] **Randy Powell**: What if I go to my next stage?

[00:06:21] **Randy Powell**: Within notice my 8 just goes straight up.

[00:06:23] **Randy Powell**: My 1.

[00:06:24] **Randy Powell**: It just goes straight up.

[00:06:26] **Randy Powell**: All right.

[00:06:27] **Randy Powell**: I could say the same thing.

[00:06:29] **Randy Powell**: My 4 and my 5 that were here just went straight up.

[00:06:35] **Randy Powell**: I know this is a little confusing to look at.

[00:06:37] **Randy Powell**: You have to go look at it from stage to stage.

[00:06:40] **Randy Powell**: But if I have the same, my 2 and 7, whenever they reach the top, on my next stage, notice

[00:06:45] **Randy Powell**: 2 is over here, 7 is over here.

[00:06:49] **Randy Powell**: So what they're doing is they multiply as making a vortex.

[00:06:52] **Randy Powell**: It's coming in every third it inverts.

[00:06:57] **Randy Powell**: Okay.

[00:06:58] **Randy Powell**: Whenever it crosses the center, whenever these numbers cross the zero, across through the

[00:07:05] **Randy Powell**: hole, they invert.

[00:07:08] **Randy Powell**: They turn upside down.

[00:07:10] **Randy Powell**: They reverse a mirror image.

[00:07:13] **Randy Powell**: And that is what this is modeling.

[00:07:17] **Randy Powell**: So I've accounted for all the principles we had, got family number groups, got rid

[00:07:22] **Randy Powell**: of the numbers, got reciprocal, multiplying, dividing.

[00:07:26] **Randy Powell**: We've got addition and subtraction, which is how things get, by the way, a positive or

[00:07:30] **Randy Powell**: a negative as a sign symbol that we're familiar with.

[00:07:35] **Randy Powell**: This energy is what imparts the positive, motive momentum to everything.

[00:07:41] **Randy Powell**: It is a positive force, which is ultimately what everything is based on.

[00:07:50] **Randy Powell**: It's creating a duality, which is really part of a trinity.

[00:07:54] **Randy Powell**: You could think of the 3 and 6 as male and female.

[00:07:57] **Randy Powell**: Again, in the arrow, the straight line towards the balance equilibrium of the 6.

[00:08:07] **Randy Powell**: So one more thing I should do, powers of 10.

[00:08:13] **Randy Powell**: I don't have a board for that, but I think everyone will be able to follow me.

[00:08:18] **Randy Powell**: This was the last thing of our symbol, just to be a little more thorough powers of 10.

[00:08:24] **Randy Powell**: Because not only am I showing doubling here, but I'm showing, you know, when you draw

[00:08:28] **Randy Powell**: numbers, when you have 100, 1000, 10,000, we put the comma with every third number.

[00:08:34] **Randy Powell**: That's not just arbitrary.

[00:08:37] **Randy Powell**: Numbers themselves aren't just arbitrary.

[00:08:38] **Randy Powell**: We don't have 10 at base 10, because we count on 10 fingers.

[00:08:42] **Randy Powell**: These numbers are actually conditions for creation.

[00:08:47] **Randy Powell**: They're not only just quantities, but they're qualities.

[00:08:50] **Randy Powell**: They have aspects.

[00:08:52] **Randy Powell**: They have ratios.

[00:08:54] **Randy Powell**: Everything in number is an angle and a ratio.

[00:08:59] **Randy Powell**: In other words, where is it moving?

[00:09:01] **Randy Powell**: What's its direction of travel?

[00:09:03] **Randy Powell**: And how much of it is there?

[00:09:06] **Randy Powell**: Angle and ratio.

[00:09:08] **Randy Powell**: So, what was I saying?

[00:09:11] **Randy Powell**: Oh, powers of 10.

[00:09:14] **Randy Powell**: So, if I take one, then I have one.

[00:09:17] **Randy Powell**: Half a one is 0.5, right?

[00:09:19] **Randy Powell**: But really what we're doing is, this is really one over one.

[00:09:22] **Randy Powell**: This is going to be five over 10.

[00:09:25] **Randy Powell**: So I'm going to have my 10s place here, 0.5.

[00:09:28] **Randy Powell**: Then I'm going to go to 0.25, which is really 0.225, 100s.

[00:09:33] **Randy Powell**: Or it wouldn't be 0.5, but it'd be 0.25 100s.

[00:09:37] **Randy Powell**: And I have 0.125, which is thousands.

[00:09:42] **Randy Powell**: 0.0625, which is 10,000s again, align with my 10.

[00:09:48] **Randy Powell**: Then I'm going to go to 100,000s, which is align with my 100.

[00:09:53] **Randy Powell**: Then I'm going to go to a millions.
