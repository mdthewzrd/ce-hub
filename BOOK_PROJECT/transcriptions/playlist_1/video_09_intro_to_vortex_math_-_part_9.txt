[00:00:00] **Randy Powell**: which is lying with the one.

[00:00:01] **Randy Powell**: 10 million, back with the 10.

[00:00:04] **Randy Powell**: 100 million.

[00:00:05] **Randy Powell**: I'm at 100.

[00:00:06] **Randy Powell**: I'm out here as far out as I can get.

[00:00:08] **Randy Powell**: That's why we say 100% because it's the full capacity.

[00:00:13] **Randy Powell**: It's what 100 is.

[00:00:15] **Randy Powell**: And ultimately, that is what numbers are modeling.

[00:00:20] **Randy Powell**: They are actually real.

[00:00:22] **Randy Powell**: They're emanations.

[00:00:24] **Randy Powell**: And they're showing how reality is spread out,

[00:00:27] **Randy Powell**: how it's given a metric.

[00:00:30] **Randy Powell**: It's showing how everything is sorted by this vortex,

[00:00:34] **Randy Powell**: by this energy.

[00:00:36] **Randy Powell**: So we, again, just accounting for our powers of 10 there

[00:00:41] **Randy Powell**: is a function of our halving, which is precisely related

[00:00:46] **Randy Powell**: to our reciprocals, to our doubling, to our family number

[00:00:49] **Randy Powell**: groups, all of those interwoven into this one symbol.

[00:00:54] **Randy Powell**: I could go on and on for days about this symbol

[00:00:57] **Randy Powell**: and all the things you can do with it.

[00:00:58] **Randy Powell**: I will say this final thing before we move on.

[00:01:02] **Randy Powell**: Whenever you get stuck in the math,

[00:01:04] **Randy Powell**: go back to your symbol.

[00:01:06] **Randy Powell**: If it doesn't work in the symbol,

[00:01:08] **Randy Powell**: then you need to think it through more.

[00:01:11] **Randy Powell**: You've got to find the deeper connection

[00:01:13] **Randy Powell**: of what's going on here.

[00:01:16] **Randy Powell**: This symbol has all the information

[00:01:19] **Randy Powell**: that you're ever going to get in any stage of the math, which

[00:01:22] **Randy Powell**: is going to get highly complex.

[00:01:25] **Randy Powell**: And I hope to eventually be revealing that.

[00:01:27] **Randy Powell**: So this was everything I had to say for right now

[00:01:31] **Randy Powell**: on our symbol of enlightenment.

[00:01:33] **Randy Powell**: And now we're going to move on to the next step.

[00:01:39] **Randy Powell**: OK, so we've had a fairly thorough going

[00:01:43] **Randy Powell**: over of this symbol, symbol of enlightenment,

[00:01:47] **Randy Powell**: which is the mathematical decryption

[00:01:50] **Randy Powell**: of the most great name of God.

[00:01:53] **Randy Powell**: It's another topic I like to talk a lot

[00:01:55] **Randy Powell**: about, but I want to just stay focused on the math right now.

[00:02:00] **Randy Powell**: From here, we're going to change to something a little different.

[00:02:06] **Randy Powell**: But we have to keep in mind all the principles we've

[00:02:09] **Randy Powell**: discussed so far, because what this symbol explains,

[00:02:12] **Randy Powell**: now we're going to show in a whole new way

[00:02:15] **Randy Powell**: that's going to lead to us being able to model true 3D reality.

[00:02:22] **Randy Powell**: And what we're going to do is take this numerology

[00:02:24] **Randy Powell**: of the symbol and turn it into something

[00:02:27] **Randy Powell**: called quantum numerology, like as in quantum mechanics,

[00:02:33] **Randy Powell**: as in quantizing or giving spatial or a tile or a value

[00:02:39] **Randy Powell**: or an amount to any of these numbers.

[00:02:43] **Randy Powell**: And to find the true secret of what I meant

[00:02:45] **Randy Powell**: when I was talking about angle and ratio,

[00:02:49] **Randy Powell**: how that works in three dimensions.

[00:02:52] **Randy Powell**: So we can quantize numbers in any of our geometric shapes

[00:02:58] **Randy Powell**: that we're working with, whether it's triangle, the hexagon,

[00:03:03] **Randy Powell**: the diamond.

[00:03:05] **Randy Powell**: Of course, the 9 is the source of everything.

[00:03:07] **Randy Powell**: So we're going to start by talking about the diamond,

[00:03:10] **Randy Powell**: by quantizing numbers and diamonds.

[00:03:14] **Randy Powell**: Now you may be confused at what I'm talking about right now.

[00:03:18] **Randy Powell**: So let me bring up this to help.

[00:03:22] **Randy Powell**: This symbol, let me say, the first thing is incorrect,

[00:03:25] **Randy Powell**: because what you're seeing here is squares.

[00:03:28] **Randy Powell**: I did it that way, because this was graphed down.

[00:03:30] **Randy Powell**: It was easier to do.

[00:03:31] **Randy Powell**: It really should be diamonds.

[00:03:33] **Randy Powell**: They should really be like this.

[00:03:34] **Randy Powell**: And these lines should truly be coming at an angle.

[00:03:38] **Randy Powell**: But you don't need to worry too much about that right now.

[00:03:41] **Randy Powell**: I'm going to explain it to you as we go.

[00:03:46] **Randy Powell**: This beautiful chart is the quantizing of numbers,

[00:03:54] **Randy Powell**: giving each diamond tile a number, a function,

[00:03:59] **Randy Powell**: and a value, a quality, and a quantity.

[00:04:05] **Randy Powell**: With this map, you can model all the principles of physics.

[00:04:10] **Randy Powell**: You can reveal the true secret of the atom.

[00:04:14] **Randy Powell**: And all that we're going to go over.

[00:04:17] **Randy Powell**: So let's just take a look at what we have going on over here.

[00:04:20] **Randy Powell**: And then I'm going to do something really impressive.

[00:04:22] **Randy Powell**: I'm going to turn it into a 3D object.

[00:04:26] **Randy Powell**: If you notice again, I said this should be at an angle.

[00:04:29] **Randy Powell**: So really, going up like this should be vertical.

[00:04:33] **Randy Powell**: Now my multiplication table is I was modeling before.

[00:04:38] **Randy Powell**: I'm modeling now here in this interconnected series.

[00:04:41] **Randy Powell**: Let's start here.

[00:04:42] **Randy Powell**: There's a 1 right here.

[00:04:44] **Randy Powell**: If I go up, notice I'm going multiples of 1.

[00:04:47] **Randy Powell**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

[00:04:52] **Randy Powell**: So that means here's my 9.

[00:04:54] **Randy Powell**: So there must be a mirror image with the 8s going down.

[00:04:58] **Randy Powell**: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.

[00:05:06] **Randy Powell**: So this, my 1 and 8s polar number pair,

[00:05:10] **Randy Powell**: are modeling my vertical axis.

[00:05:13] **Randy Powell**: This system obsulates the Cartesian coordinate system

[00:05:17] **Randy Powell**: and shows how to model a truth in your 3D.

[00:05:22] **Randy Powell**: How about if I go this way?

[00:05:23] **Randy Powell**: This would really be my horizontal again

[00:05:25] **Randy Powell**: if I was at that angle.

[00:05:27] **Randy Powell**: If I start with 5, I have 5, 10, 15, to 6, 20, 25, 30, 35.

[00:05:37] **Randy Powell**: Multiple of 5 going this way.

[00:05:40] **Randy Powell**: Again, there's my 9.

[00:05:41] **Randy Powell**: I must have multiples of 4 going this way.

[00:05:44] **Randy Powell**: 4, 8, 12, which is 3, 16, 7, 20, 2, 24, 6.

[00:05:55] **Randy Powell**: So multiples of 1 and 8 are my vertical axis.

[00:05:58] **Randy Powell**: Multiple of 4 and 5 are my horizontal axis.

[00:06:02] **Randy Powell**: Everything around this 9.

[00:06:05] **Randy Powell**: Notice here I have 6 and 3, 2 and 7, 1 and 8, 4 and 5.

[00:06:11] **Randy Powell**: All the polar number pairs positioned around my 9.

[00:06:15] **Randy Powell**: This red 9 is a positive 9.

[00:06:19] **Randy Powell**: OK?

[00:06:22] **Randy Powell**: So my 1 and 8s are my vertical.

[00:06:24] **Randy Powell**: My 4 and 5s are my horizontal.

[00:06:27] **Randy Powell**: But then what about my 2 and 7?

[00:06:30] **Randy Powell**: Where is that?

[00:06:31] **Randy Powell**: What do you see with those 2 and 7 here?

[00:06:33] **Randy Powell**: Is it this?

[00:06:33] **Randy Powell**: Well, no, those aren't multiples of 2 or 7, 2, 5, 6, no, 7, 4, 3.

[00:06:40] **Randy Powell**: No, that doesn't work.

[00:06:40] **Randy Powell**: So it's not that.

[00:06:42] **Randy Powell**: My z-axis is actually coming from the inside out.

[00:06:46] **Randy Powell**: The 7 and 2, which is the z-axis here, are coming out, piercing through the skin.

[00:06:52] **Randy Powell**: There are emanations.

[00:06:54] **Randy Powell**: They're invisible.

[00:06:56] **Randy Powell**: But you can see them by the way that they're displacing the other numbers.

[00:06:59] **Randy Powell**: And I'm going to show you that, but I want to show you some other things first.

[00:07:03] **Randy Powell**: What are other things we're looking for here?

[00:07:05] **Randy Powell**: Well, I notice if I come this way, I've got my doubling.

[00:07:08] **Randy Powell**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1, 2, 4, 8.

[00:07:14] **Randy Powell**: And if I go this way, I've got doubling going the other direction.

[00:07:17] **Randy Powell**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5.

[00:07:20] **Randy Powell**: Or I could say I have halfing.

[00:07:22] **Randy Powell**: Right?

[00:07:23] **Randy Powell**: They're both going on at the same time.

[00:07:25] **Randy Powell**: These are mirror image doubling circuits.

[00:07:28] **Randy Powell**: We call them circuits because through doubling, all vibration is passed.

[00:07:34] **Randy Powell**: And anything with mass.

[00:07:37] **Randy Powell**: So all materials moving.

[00:07:39] **Randy Powell**: When you make electrical coils, these can be circuits.

[00:07:43] **Randy Powell**: Right?

[00:07:44] **Randy Powell**: So I have doubling going this way, doubling going that way.

[00:07:47] **Randy Powell**: And then notice what's in between them?

[00:07:50] **Randy Powell**: My 9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 6, 9, 3, 3.

[00:07:55] **Randy Powell**: The multiplication series of my 36 and 9,

[00:08:00] **Randy Powell**: or the doubling of my 36 and 9, making this.

[00:08:03] **Randy Powell**: And notice what happens?

[00:08:04] **Randy Powell**: The 6, the 3 and the 6, they never touch.

[00:08:09] **Randy Powell**: They're just like magnetic poles.

[00:08:11] **Randy Powell**: They repel each other.

[00:08:15] **Randy Powell**: So that's very important to recognize.

[00:08:19] **Randy Powell**: And between the 3 and 6, there's always a 9.

[00:08:22] **Randy Powell**: And there's never a 3 and 6 connecting

[00:08:25] **Randy Powell**: where there's not a 9 in between them.

[00:08:27] **Randy Powell**: The 9 is the control for everything.

[00:08:30] **Randy Powell**: Also here, if I take in this group of 9 towels,

[00:08:32] **Randy Powell**: I have 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5.

[00:08:35] **Randy Powell**: Another board to see here.

[00:08:37] **Randy Powell**: Remember, we were talking about the vortex.

[00:08:40] **Randy Powell**: But we'll wait till we look at the 3D model

[00:08:42] **Randy Powell**: to show what that really is.

[00:08:44] **Randy Powell**: I just want you to see that I've got my vertical.

[00:08:46] **Randy Powell**: I've got my horizontal.

[00:08:48] **Randy Powell**: When I said you can see my z-axis

[00:08:51] **Randy Powell**: by how it's displacing everything, what did I mean?

[00:08:54] **Randy Powell**: I mean, by the numbers surrounding a number.

[00:08:57] **Randy Powell**: Let's take a one, for instance.

[00:08:59] **Randy Powell**: This is a positive one.

[00:09:01] **Randy Powell**: So an etheron is emanating out from the center.

[00:09:05] **Randy Powell**: It's activating this number.

[00:09:06] **Randy Powell**: Well, let's look at the numbers around it.

[00:09:09] **Randy Powell**: Now, if we're talking about multiples of 7,

[00:09:11] **Randy Powell**: and I'm lining it up with my 1, then I know it's

[00:09:13] **Randy Powell**: going to be 7 here.

[00:09:14] **Randy Powell**: So if I look here, 5 plus 2 is 7, 6 and 1 is 7.

[00:09:21] **Randy Powell**: And then I have 9 plus 2 is 2, 5 and 6 is 2.

[00:09:25] **Randy Powell**: So 2 and 7 are shown by the way those numbers are surrounding.

[00:09:31] **Randy Powell**: You could do that.

[00:09:34] **Randy Powell**: Let's say if I'm doing 4, then I would be 1 and 8

[00:09:41] **Randy Powell**: would be because 1 would be the multiple in that series

[00:09:46] **Randy Powell**: of 7 piercing through the 4.

[00:09:48] **Randy Powell**: Probably no one's going to follow what I'm saying here.

[00:09:49] **Randy Powell**: But you can see still, I predicted it would be 1 and 8.

[00:09:53] **Randy Powell**: You have 7 and 3 is 10 is 1, 8 and 2 is 1.
