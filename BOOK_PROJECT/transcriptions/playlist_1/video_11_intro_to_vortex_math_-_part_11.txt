[00:00:00] **Randy Powell**: Now each time one of those emanations comes out,

[00:00:04] **Randy Powell**: here's another example.

[00:00:05] **Randy Powell**: You can see my reds there emanating out,

[00:00:08] **Randy Powell**: causing the blues to come in.

[00:00:11] **Randy Powell**: This is an example in my, I'm showing my yellow,

[00:00:15] **Randy Powell**: my yellows here are the numbers that are activated.

[00:00:19] **Randy Powell**: All right, this is the southern half.

[00:00:21] **Randy Powell**: So these emanations coming out are activating those

[00:00:25] **Randy Powell**: in every other one sequence.

[00:00:27] **Randy Powell**: And training matter in this way,

[00:00:30] **Randy Powell**: and training motion.

[00:00:33] **Randy Powell**: What's the cutting edge on the top,

[00:00:34] **Randy Powell**: and there's the trailing edge on the other side,

[00:00:36] **Randy Powell**: totally reverses, the cutting edge on the top

[00:00:39] **Randy Powell**: becomes the trailing edge on the bottom.

[00:00:42] **Randy Powell**: So in every way, just like our three in six,

[00:00:46] **Randy Powell**: the three representing the coming in,

[00:00:48] **Randy Powell**: the top northern male half,

[00:00:50] **Randy Powell**: the six representing the female birthgiving,

[00:00:52] **Randy Powell**: southern half, there are always mirror images.

[00:00:56] **Randy Powell**: It's a very important principle in this math.

[00:01:02] **Randy Powell**: So when we take these numbers,

[00:01:04] **Randy Powell**: and then we start to model a Taurus,

[00:01:06] **Randy Powell**: the question is, what are we really looking at?

[00:01:10] **Randy Powell**: Up until now, the model for the Taurus

[00:01:16] **Randy Powell**: and how to design a coil has been based on this model.

[00:01:22] **Randy Powell**: Oops.

[00:01:30] **Randy Powell**: And what we're going to have to do is take groups of nine

[00:01:33] **Randy Powell**: and lengthen together so that they form unbroken circles,

[00:01:38] **Randy Powell**: so that I have a one and eight as a circle,

[00:01:41] **Randy Powell**: both positive and negative.

[00:01:44] **Randy Powell**: Just like here, I have my positive numbers going up here,

[00:01:50] **Randy Powell**: and then going in the opposite direction,

[00:01:53] **Randy Powell**: my black ones are negative,

[00:01:55] **Randy Powell**: but the same multiplication series, one and eight,

[00:01:59] **Randy Powell**: and then four and five, it's the same,

[00:02:00] **Randy Powell**: I'm going positive ones, these are negative.

[00:02:03] **Randy Powell**: So every other one is positive and negative,

[00:02:05] **Randy Powell**: which is causing, I'm allowing that binary motion

[00:02:11] **Randy Powell**: to go on along the doubling circuits.

[00:02:14] **Randy Powell**: And also, there's never any more of any number

[00:02:20] **Randy Powell**: than any other number, they're always in exact proportion.

[00:02:26] **Randy Powell**: And so the smallest I can have to make a Taurus

[00:02:29] **Randy Powell**: is a nine by nine, and I'm going to show how that works.

[00:02:32] **Randy Powell**: I was never understood until I did the work on it

[00:02:35] **Randy Powell**: to actually show how to map a true Taurus.

[00:02:39] **Randy Powell**: When you're making these Taurus as a standard way

[00:02:41] **Randy Powell**: that people have been winding the coils,

[00:02:43] **Randy Powell**: based on the family number groups,

[00:02:45] **Randy Powell**: along just a flat series of one to 36.

[00:02:52] **Randy Powell**: So this is only accounting really for a single horizontal axis.

[00:03:00] **Randy Powell**: So in this one, I was going one to 16, which is seven,

[00:03:04] **Randy Powell**: and I'm going back up here to 31, which is four.

[00:03:08] **Randy Powell**: So I've got one, seven, four.

[00:03:10] **Randy Powell**: On my third one, I'm at a right angle to the first one,

[00:03:13] **Randy Powell**: and that's 10, again, back to one.

[00:03:16] **Randy Powell**: 25, which is seven, four, which is four.

[00:03:21] **Randy Powell**: 19, which is one, again, at a right angle to that last one.

[00:03:26] **Randy Powell**: Everything's always at a right angle,

[00:03:28] **Randy Powell**: so it's moving in a star shape.

[00:03:30] **Randy Powell**: Notice you have parallel lines.

[00:03:33] **Randy Powell**: Any way you go, you can make any of these parallel lines.

[00:03:37] **Randy Powell**: So there are these parallel fields going on.

[00:03:40] **Randy Powell**: And this winding in a star shape is referred to as spires.

[00:03:45] **Randy Powell**: There are the family number groups crossing over each other

[00:03:48] **Randy Powell**: in a triangulated sequence.

[00:03:51] **Randy Powell**: This as a coil is built from two wires.

[00:03:54] **Randy Powell**: One is the green wire, which is wrapping back around

[00:03:58] **Randy Powell**: until it connects to itself.

[00:04:00] **Randy Powell**: So if you want to see the paths,

[00:04:01] **Randy Powell**: going one, two, three, one, two, three, two, three, one, two.

[00:04:08] **Randy Powell**: And then back to where it started.

[00:04:11] **Randy Powell**: And the orange is your two, five, and eight.

[00:04:14] **Randy Powell**: And those are moving in a mirror image direction.

[00:04:18] **Randy Powell**: And then you have a space for your three, nine, and six,

[00:04:21] **Randy Powell**: which is your yellow there.

[00:04:22] **Randy Powell**: That space allows us etheron, flux, magnetic field to occur,

[00:04:27] **Randy Powell**: which is supposed to pull the electricity

[00:04:31] **Randy Powell**: and train it and synchronize it so that it moves

[00:04:33] **Randy Powell**: that it's fastest acceleration possible,

[00:04:36] **Randy Powell**: making what's called an electrical Venturi, electrical vortex.

[00:04:42] **Randy Powell**: Over the surface of this are supposed to be

[00:04:47] **Randy Powell**: these smaller one, two, four, eight, seven, five.

[00:04:51] **Randy Powell**: One, here's a pot, here's a negative vortex going in,

[00:04:56] **Randy Powell**: because my nine is positive, so when my nine's coming out,

[00:04:59] **Randy Powell**: the three and six are going in,

[00:05:00] **Randy Powell**: and they're entraining this vortex in,

[00:05:03] **Randy Powell**: where my negative nine is I have a positive vortex coming out,

[00:05:07] **Randy Powell**: and they're actually shearing against each other,

[00:05:10] **Randy Powell**: which brings me to another important point.

[00:05:17] **Randy Powell**: So I have two different borrasses over the surface.

[00:05:19] **Randy Powell**: If you want an analogy, that's what these are.

[00:05:24] **Randy Powell**: They're like dimples on a golf ball.

[00:05:27] **Randy Powell**: They're like sunspots.

[00:05:29] **Randy Powell**: We call them underpinned nested vortices.

[00:05:32] **Randy Powell**: You can call them Coriolis forces.

[00:05:36] **Randy Powell**: They entraining everything,

[00:05:38] **Randy Powell**: and they have a sequence order and a flow to how they work.

[00:05:42] **Randy Powell**: And I discovered actually how that works.

[00:05:47] **Randy Powell**: So when a nine is coming out,

[00:05:50] **Randy Powell**: we have a negative vortex going in,

[00:05:52] **Randy Powell**: so the polarity of the vorticity is opposite

[00:05:55] **Randy Powell**: the polarity of your actual center number.

[00:05:59] **Randy Powell**: If the number is positive, the vorticity is negative.

[00:06:02] **Randy Powell**: If the number is negative, the vorticity is positive flowing out.

[00:06:07] **Randy Powell**: And these are, these vortices increase the acceleration

[00:06:12] **Randy Powell**: of the flow of electricity by pulling it and entraining it.

[00:06:15] **Randy Powell**: The idea being that pull stronger than push,

[00:06:18] **Randy Powell**: implosion always must precede explosion,

[00:06:22] **Randy Powell**: even when you're igniting gasoline and such things.

[00:06:27] **Randy Powell**: So the other important point that I wanted to make is

[00:06:31] **Randy Powell**: if we go back to our symbol now,

[00:06:32] **Randy Powell**: we look for all our principles.

[00:06:34] **Randy Powell**: We've got multiplication series as circles,

[00:06:38] **Randy Powell**: even though this is on a flat piece of paper,

[00:06:40] **Randy Powell**: really there would be circles of vertical axis,

[00:06:43] **Randy Powell**: or horizontal axis, then as the axis going straight.

[00:06:47] **Randy Powell**: So we have multiplication tables as circles,

[00:06:49] **Randy Powell**: we have multiplication series as straight lines.

[00:06:53] **Randy Powell**: We have doubling, unbroken doubling circuits.

[00:06:57] **Randy Powell**: Of course we haven't proved they're unbroken yet,

[00:06:59] **Randy Powell**: but we're gonna show that.

[00:07:00] **Randy Powell**: We have doubling circuits going this way.

[00:07:02] **Randy Powell**: So we're counting, you could say if you look

[00:07:04] **Randy Powell**: at the one overarching direction,

[00:07:06] **Randy Powell**: you're counting for both doubling and halfing as the principle.

[00:07:11] **Randy Powell**: Now ideally, these tiles would be getting bigger and smaller

[00:07:14] **Randy Powell**: because they actually expand and contract,

[00:07:16] **Randy Powell**: but that depends on what your numerical system is

[00:07:21] **Randy Powell**: that you're using, so that's a little more advanced.

[00:07:24] **Randy Powell**: So when we're working with the numbers like this,

[00:07:28] **Randy Powell**: we've accounted for multiplication series,

[00:07:30] **Randy Powell**: we have doubling, we have our etheron,

[00:07:32] **Randy Powell**: flux magnetic field, we have family number groups,

[00:07:35] **Randy Powell**: we have all the activation series,

[00:07:38] **Randy Powell**: what about reciprocals?

[00:07:40] **Randy Powell**: Remember I said my control is one.

[00:07:44] **Randy Powell**: Let's look on the other side.

[00:07:45] **Randy Powell**: Now we've been looking at these groups,

[00:07:47] **Randy Powell**: which is everything centered on the nine,

[00:07:49] **Randy Powell**: and these are the main groups,

[00:07:51] **Randy Powell**: and everything is always spinning around nine.

[00:07:54] **Randy Powell**: It's always your axis.

[00:07:57] **Randy Powell**: What I also have though is this relationship here,

[00:08:00] **Randy Powell**: the one and the one, the two and the five,

[00:08:02] **Randy Powell**: seven, four, eight and eight,

[00:08:04] **Randy Powell**: which are our reciprocals that we learn on our symbol.

[00:08:08] **Randy Powell**: One times one is one, two times five is ten and is one.

[00:08:12] **Randy Powell**: Seven times four is 28, which is one.

[00:08:15] **Randy Powell**: Eight times eight is 64, which is one.

[00:08:17] **Randy Powell**: On and on, you can do that on this side,

[00:08:19] **Randy Powell**: you can do that on this side.

[00:08:21] **Randy Powell**: That is precisely what is contributing to everything

[00:08:25] **Randy Powell**: being in these groups centered around your three, nine,

[00:08:28] **Randy Powell**: and six, specifically the nine.

[00:08:32] **Randy Powell**: Because they're creating a shear,

[00:08:34] **Randy Powell**: let's call it a shear.

[00:08:35] **Randy Powell**: If you want an explanation for a shear,

[00:08:37] **Randy Powell**: you spin a cylinder around and grab onto it,

[00:08:40] **Randy Powell**: so the common explanation,

[00:08:42] **Randy Powell**: and you will feel the shear as it's shearing your hand off.

[00:08:45] **Randy Powell**: If on the other hand, you're moving at the same speed

[00:08:47] **Randy Powell**: as that cylinder, you won't feel anything.

[00:08:50] **Randy Powell**: A shear is any spinning system,

[00:08:54] **Randy Powell**: any revolving system is gonna have a boundary condition,

[00:08:57] **Randy Powell**: a bounded infinity to it.

[00:09:00] **Randy Powell**: It's gonna be centered on an axis, just like our bodies.

[00:09:04] **Randy Powell**: So it has mirror symmetry.

[00:09:07] **Randy Powell**: Now, this shear means that you can touch

[00:09:11] **Randy Powell**: two different wires together, two wires,

[00:09:14] **Randy Powell**: and they won't short out,

[00:09:16] **Randy Powell**: because they're harmonics or resonance is so perfect.

[00:09:19] **Randy Powell**: Notice that it's always positive negative, negative positive,

[00:09:22] **Randy Powell**: positive negative, negative positive.

[00:09:24] **Randy Powell**: So they're always creating a perfect, resonant, harmonic shear

[00:09:30] **Randy Powell**: by the extreme acceleration and motion in one direction,

[00:09:34] **Randy Powell**: while the other one's going in the other direction,

[00:09:36] **Randy Powell**: they create a world boundary condition.

[00:09:39] **Randy Powell**: This is highly significant for engineering.

[00:09:43] **Randy Powell**: So now I've also accounted for my reciprocals.

[00:09:47] **Randy Powell**: If I was using a different control from my Toroid,

[00:09:49] **Randy Powell**: I would still have all of these principles.

[00:09:52] **Randy Powell**: But that is again a little more advanced.

[00:09:57] **Randy Powell**: So.
