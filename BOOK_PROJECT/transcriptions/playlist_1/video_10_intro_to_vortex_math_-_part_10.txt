[00:00:00] **Randy Powell**: 9 and 8 is 8, 5 and 3 is 8.

[00:00:04] **Randy Powell**: Alright, so I can do that for any number and show how the values are intersecting.

[00:00:10] **Randy Powell**: And when that works, it makes this whole skin vibrate in channel motion.

[00:00:16] **Randy Powell**: So before I get back to this, let me just show you ultimately what that turns into.

[00:00:23] **Randy Powell**: This is called the torus, the torroid.

[00:00:29] **Randy Powell**: Okay, there's a lot of different names for it.

[00:00:32] **Randy Powell**: This is this acoil, it's a sunflower.

[00:00:37] **Randy Powell**: This is the shape and this system of the universe.

[00:00:42] **Randy Powell**: It's modeling this compression, decompression.

[00:00:45] **Randy Powell**: So when you build a torus mathematically, all you're showing on your vertical axis,

[00:00:51] **Randy Powell**: multiples of 1 and 8, you got your form 5 when you're horizontal.

[00:00:55] **Randy Powell**: Really, this is just one torus. There's other ways to build them.

[00:00:58] **Randy Powell**: But I'm going to stick with my 1 and 8's as my control.

[00:01:02] **Randy Powell**: So I have 1 and 8 on the horizontal, 4 and 5,

[00:01:05] **Randy Powell**: and I've got doubling moving it. Angular motion.

[00:01:08] **Randy Powell**: Just like on my symbol, the doubling circuits is probably a little hard to see in some of these.

[00:01:13] **Randy Powell**: I, here would be 1 moving in at an angle towards the center.

[00:01:18] **Randy Powell**: Here's my linear energy coming out from the center moving in straight lines.

[00:01:24] **Randy Powell**: Notice every number it's activating is separated by thirds,

[00:01:27] **Randy Powell**: which again is probably a little hard to see in this model,

[00:01:30] **Randy Powell**: but you have 5, 6, 7, 8.

[00:01:33] **Randy Powell**: This is my 25 and 8 family number group, the moment when it's activated.

[00:01:38] **Randy Powell**: So you can have your, you have a moment for the 1, 4, 7,

[00:01:42] **Randy Powell**: this moment for the 25, 8, this moment for the 396.

[00:01:46] **Randy Powell**: It's like a pulsing, that's a phasing or a sequence order.

[00:01:51] **Randy Powell**: So 25 and 8, they're all separated by thirds.

[00:01:55] **Randy Powell**: They're separated by thirds on their vertical axis.

[00:01:58] **Randy Powell**: They're separated by thirds on their horizontal axis.

[00:02:01] **Randy Powell**: They're separated by thirds on the z-axis.

[00:02:05] **Randy Powell**: Because the z-axis is this emanation coming out,

[00:02:09] **Randy Powell**: giving the number its positive polarity sign symbol,

[00:02:13] **Randy Powell**: and causing a negative back draft coming back this way,

[00:02:17] **Randy Powell**: which is gravity, which is in training everything inwards.

[00:02:21] **Randy Powell**: And when we talk about in training synchronization,

[00:02:24] **Randy Powell**: that's created by this energy deflecting everything,

[00:02:28] **Randy Powell**: causing it to vibrate and to center itself around a center of gravity.

[00:02:35] **Randy Powell**: You could say that's why you always have a center of gravity.

[00:02:39] **Randy Powell**: Again, just so you can look, here's the DNA symbol,

[00:02:42] **Randy Powell**: and you can see that initial symbol of enlightenment right in here,

[00:02:45] **Randy Powell**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, and here's your 9, 3, 6.

[00:02:49] **Randy Powell**: You can actually see it in the DNA,

[00:02:51] **Randy Powell**: but we're not going to go into that right now.

[00:02:54] **Randy Powell**: So this ultimately makes the shape of the universe.

[00:02:58] **Randy Powell**: The big bang is just one explosion coming out,

[00:03:01] **Randy Powell**: eventually curving back around in, imploding at the top,

[00:03:05] **Randy Powell**: where it's concentrating all its heat,

[00:03:07] **Randy Powell**: and literally squeezing the energy out,

[00:03:10] **Randy Powell**: emanates back out re- and livening everything.

[00:03:16] **Randy Powell**: Out of that, you can design a coil.

[00:03:20] **Randy Powell**: Now the coil that I'm designing now is a little bit different

[00:03:22] **Randy Powell**: than the standard coil.

[00:03:24] **Randy Powell**: Whoops, awesome.

[00:03:31] **Randy Powell**: So we're talking about the Taurus.

[00:03:33] **Randy Powell**: This again is a version looking from the top half of a Taurus.

[00:03:37] **Randy Powell**: You can see these doubling circuits curving in,

[00:03:40] **Randy Powell**: moving at an angle, forming a vortex.

[00:03:44] **Randy Powell**: This is why in relativity everything warps and curves.

[00:03:47] **Randy Powell**: It's warping and curving around a linear energy,

[00:03:51] **Randy Powell**: sorry, linear energy, which is imparting to everything,

[00:03:56] **Randy Powell**: its geometric structure and function.

[00:04:00] **Randy Powell**: Everything is composed of really two aspects,

[00:04:03] **Randy Powell**: form and function,

[00:04:05] **Randy Powell**: and that's what mathematics is all about modeling.

[00:04:08] **Randy Powell**: Here's another picture of a Taurus.

[00:04:11] **Randy Powell**: This is a southern half now.

[00:04:13] **Randy Powell**: Notice it's in a mirror image,

[00:04:15] **Randy Powell**: the northern half curving and counterclockwise,

[00:04:18] **Randy Powell**: imploding the southern half, exploding clockwise,

[00:04:23] **Randy Powell**: and it's still the same one-way motion,

[00:04:26] **Randy Powell**: but its overarching curvature is now inverted on the southern half.

[00:04:31] **Randy Powell**: So just like in my symbol, when my number is inverted,

[00:04:34] **Randy Powell**: that is preserved in the Taurus.

[00:04:37] **Randy Powell**: And so this is the Taurus skin.

[00:04:45] **Randy Powell**: It's composed.

[00:04:46] **Randy Powell**: You have to have interlocking multiplication tables.

[00:04:49] **Randy Powell**: Again, this is just what my control is.

[00:04:51] **Randy Powell**: One, you always have to have doubling,

[00:04:54] **Randy Powell**: and you always want this 396 to be in between your two pathways of doubling.

[00:05:01] **Randy Powell**: So what I have here, my red, nines, and threes and sixes,

[00:05:07] **Randy Powell**: we're going to say are positive.

[00:05:09] **Randy Powell**: My black ones are negative.

[00:05:12] **Randy Powell**: Now notice if I'm moving in an angle,

[00:05:14] **Randy Powell**: I'm preserving positive negative, positive negative, positive negative, positive negative.

[00:05:20] **Randy Powell**: A binary flip flop.

[00:05:23] **Randy Powell**: Also, as I go from one group here to the next,

[00:05:26] **Randy Powell**: you can see I've got a positive nine,

[00:05:29] **Randy Powell**: and my three and six are negative,

[00:05:31] **Randy Powell**: and I've got a negative nine, my six and three are positive.

[00:05:34] **Randy Powell**: And there are mirror image inversions here.

[00:05:37] **Randy Powell**: I've got one to four, and I'm on one to fours over here.

[00:05:40] **Randy Powell**: Eight, seven, five here, eight, seven, five here.

[00:05:42] **Randy Powell**: And the sixes and the threes are opposed.

[00:05:45] **Randy Powell**: So they're forming flip-flopping mirror images.

[00:05:50] **Randy Powell**: So we're going to have three different stages.

[00:05:54] **Randy Powell**: One's going to be my red stage.

[00:05:56] **Randy Powell**: One's going to be my green stage.

[00:05:58] **Randy Powell**: One's going to be my blue stage.

[00:06:00] **Randy Powell**: Notice that I'm modeling family number groups.

[00:06:04] **Randy Powell**: There's only two different kinds of these groups you can have,

[00:06:08] **Randy Powell**: which gives you again 18 numbers.

[00:06:11] **Randy Powell**: All right, positive and negative for each number.

[00:06:14] **Randy Powell**: On this doubling circuit, my one fours and sevens are positive,

[00:06:18] **Randy Powell**: and my two eights and fives are negative.

[00:06:20] **Randy Powell**: On this doubling circuit, my two eights and fives are positive,

[00:06:23] **Randy Powell**: and one fours and sevens are negative.

[00:06:27] **Randy Powell**: So in my first sequence of star are the positive nine.

[00:06:30] **Randy Powell**: What that means is that this energy is shooting out of the center.

[00:06:34] **Randy Powell**: You can say the nucleus or the very center where everything is condensed down,

[00:06:38] **Randy Powell**: it's heat is concentrated.

[00:06:40] **Randy Powell**: I say that near the center of a black hole, 100 million suns is the size of a pinhead.

[00:06:46] **Randy Powell**: That's how dense it is.

[00:06:48] **Randy Powell**: And all that heat and that density of matter,

[00:06:51] **Randy Powell**: and I believe actually the fastest thing traveling through the universe is not light,

[00:06:55] **Randy Powell**: is even in that black hole where the light cannot escape,

[00:06:59] **Randy Powell**: sound is being emitted, radiated.

[00:07:02] **Randy Powell**: And so sound, which we know propagates faster through more dense material,

[00:07:07] **Randy Powell**: sound moving through that density of matter, is faster than even light.

[00:07:14] **Randy Powell**: And this is sound at its perfect resonance.

[00:07:18] **Randy Powell**: So in my first group, my nine is positive, when it's emanating out,

[00:07:24] **Randy Powell**: my three and six are negative, they're going towards the center.

[00:07:28] **Randy Powell**: All right?

[00:07:30] **Randy Powell**: And that would be in this four to see here.

[00:07:33] **Randy Powell**: And the one next to it on either side of it.

[00:07:36] **Randy Powell**: You could say this is a trend in here.

[00:07:38] **Randy Powell**: On either side I have a negative nine, and I have six and three coming out.

[00:07:44] **Randy Powell**: For every action, there are two half opposite reactions,

[00:07:50] **Randy Powell**: a modification of Newton's law.

[00:07:54] **Randy Powell**: All right?

[00:07:56] **Randy Powell**: So there is my first stage, and as I move along my circuit,

[00:07:59] **Randy Powell**: I'm still preserving that positive negative, positive negative.

[00:08:03] **Randy Powell**: For every ethron that comes out, we have two parts magnetism that react to it instantaneously.

[00:08:09] **Randy Powell**: That's why magnetism is the fastest, and it's the control for electricity.

[00:08:15] **Randy Powell**: These doubling circuits modeling motion vibration, which is all electricity,

[00:08:19] **Randy Powell**: is electrons moving through a wire, are showing now two electrical moments,

[00:08:25] **Randy Powell**: two moments of activation.

[00:08:28] **Randy Powell**: One is my one, four, and sevens.

[00:08:31] **Randy Powell**: Notice if I go on my horizontal, one, two, three, there's a four.

[00:08:36] **Randy Powell**: I can go one, two, three, seven, three.

[00:08:39] **Randy Powell**: Those numbers are separated by thirds, and my horizontal, one, two, three,

[00:08:44] **Randy Powell**: one, two, three.

[00:08:46] **Randy Powell**: All my greens are separated by thirds, but going at an angle,

[00:08:50] **Randy Powell**: they're one, two, you know, they're every other one.

[00:08:54] **Randy Powell**: They're positive negative, positive negative.

[00:08:58] **Randy Powell**: So as this energy is synchronizing every different axis,

[00:09:03] **Randy Powell**: it's actually creating a flow, a motion.

[00:09:07] **Randy Powell**: So I go first, my three, nine, six, or a positive negative.

[00:09:12] **Randy Powell**: Next, my one, fours, and sevens.

[00:09:16] **Randy Powell**: And on the next one, my two, five, and eight.

[00:09:19] **Randy Powell**: So it's a one, two, three sequence, three part sequence.

[00:09:23] **Randy Powell**: Again, family number group one, so three, nine, six, family number group two, one, four, and seven.

[00:09:29] **Randy Powell**: Family number group three, two, eight, and five.

[00:09:32] **Randy Powell**: This is essential to understand for understanding how to perfectly model compression and decompression,

[00:09:38] **Randy Powell**: no matter what you're talking about, no matter what the medium.

[00:09:43] **Randy Powell**: These doubling circuits are the pathways of motion.

[00:09:49] **Randy Powell**: Okay.

[00:09:51] **Randy Powell**: So we feel pretty comfortable with that.
