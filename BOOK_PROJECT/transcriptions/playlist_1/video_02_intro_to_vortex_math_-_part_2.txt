[00:00:00] **Randy Powell**: Okay, it's what keeps creation doubling. What are examples of doubling? We could take cell division.

[00:00:06] **Randy Powell**: Okay, when you can see you have one cell which becomes two, four, eight, sixteen,

[00:00:14] **Randy Powell**: 32 cells.

[00:00:16] **Randy Powell**: They stay all together as an aggregate until they reach 64.

[00:00:21] **Randy Powell**: At 64 all the cells become individualized. They can become brain cells or heart cells, right?

[00:00:28] **Randy Powell**: So at 64 you get each cell becoming an individual. Another word showing the parallel between the 64 and the one.

[00:00:38] **Randy Powell**: Okay, this is why 64 is a cycle in the mind calendar or in the e-ching

[00:00:43] **Randy Powell**: Arrhydating back to the one. It's a completion of this cycle which we call abounded infinity.

[00:00:50] **Randy Powell**: It's an infinity of duration, constantly moving, not necessarily infinity of direction.

[00:00:57] **Randy Powell**: Because it has an axis which we're going to talk about.

[00:01:01] **Randy Powell**: Okay, what else doubles? How about music scales?

[00:01:05] **Randy Powell**: From C to C to C is doubling.

[00:01:10] **Randy Powell**: Doubling harmonics. You go from 440 to 880 or depending how you're setting your frequencies.

[00:01:16] **Randy Powell**: You have doubling in harmonics.

[00:01:19] **Randy Powell**: So there's many, many examples of these numbers of doubling and how and how that works in creation.

[00:01:28] **Randy Powell**: Take for instance,

[00:01:30] **Randy Powell**: nuclear reactions. You have one neutrino which liberates two, which liberates four, which liberates eight. In other words,

[00:01:38] **Randy Powell**: neutrinos are working on a doubling sequence as well. Sometimes it's called a chain reaction or a geometric progression.

[00:01:49] **Randy Powell**: Another example of doubling, the binary code in computers.

[00:01:54] **Randy Powell**: Okay, I can go on. We could talk about the 64 codons in the DNA. All of this

[00:02:01] **Randy Powell**: highly related. Okay, but let me continue with our basic number sequence.

[00:02:07] **Randy Powell**: What happens if I follow my track in the opposite way?

[00:02:11] **Randy Powell**: Well, if I'm doubling this way, I must be having in the other way. So let's find out if that's true.

[00:02:18] **Randy Powell**: Half of one is 0.5. Again, back to my five.

[00:02:23] **Randy Powell**: Half of 0.5 is 0.25,

[00:02:27] **Randy Powell**: two and five equals seven.

[00:02:30] **Randy Powell**: Half of 0.25 is 0.125, which equals eight.

[00:02:37] **Randy Powell**: Half of 0.125 is 0.0625, which reduces back to four.

[00:02:44] **Randy Powell**: Okay?

[00:02:45] **Randy Powell**: Halfing works the same way. I can't remember what half of 0.0625, I think, is 0.0.

[00:02:54] **Randy Powell**: Ah, forget what the number is. Anyway, you can do it. You can make the calculation on your own.

[00:03:00] **Randy Powell**: You'll find no matter how far you go, you can half. I could do it just as well. I could say half of 10 is 5.

[00:03:07] **Randy Powell**: Okay? Half of 5 is 2.5, which equals seven.

[00:03:12] **Randy Powell**: Okay, so you can do it any number of ways and it's always going to work. This is an infinite

[00:03:18] **Randy Powell**: series of halfing. Very significant.

[00:03:23] **Randy Powell**: Because when you have a motion in one way, you're going to have a trailing motion in another way,

[00:03:27] **Randy Powell**: and we're going to talk a lot about that and how it works. This black line that you're seeing here

[00:03:33] **Randy Powell**: is the pathway that everything takes that moves in creation. It is the spin continuum that the

[00:03:42] **Randy Powell**: universe is on. It's why the universe is always moving, but it's never actually going anywhere.

[00:03:50] **Randy Powell**: It's on a treadmill. It's a bounded infinity. All right? And you're going to get real familiar with

[00:03:57] **Randy Powell**: that concept of the bounded infinity. It touches everything we're going to do. But I don't want to get

[00:04:02] **Randy Powell**: two stuck on that. I want to take a look at some of the other properties of my symbol. Now,

[00:04:08] **Randy Powell**: here I've talked about six numbers. One, two, four, eight, seven, five, back to one.

[00:04:18] **Randy Powell**: What about these numbers? I have six and three and nine, and they're connected by this pyramid.

[00:04:23] **Randy Powell**: It's only connected at the top, by the way. Never connected on the bottom.

[00:04:28] **Randy Powell**: So this triangle or pyramid here connecting the three, nine, and six. Well, let's find out what

[00:04:36] **Randy Powell**: happens with these numbers when they start getting mathematical functions. Let's take three,

[00:04:44] **Randy Powell**: for instance, this smallest, the simplest. What happens when I double three? Three doubled

[00:04:52] **Randy Powell**: becomes six. Six doubled then becomes 12 and two plus one is three. 12 doubled becomes 24.

[00:05:04] **Randy Powell**: Two plus four is six. 24 doubled is 48. 4 plus 8 is 12 and 2 plus 1 is three. 48 doubled is 96,

[00:05:18] **Randy Powell**: which comes back to six. So no matter how far you double these, you're oscillating. Three,

[00:05:25] **Randy Powell**: six, three, six. Halfing would be the same. I could say half a six is three. Half of three is 1.5,

[00:05:32] **Randy Powell**: just six. You could do it any number of ways. Half a 30 is 15, just six. No matter which way you do

[00:05:40] **Randy Powell**: it, halfing or doubling, three and six are oscillating back and forth. None of these numbers do

[00:05:47] **Randy Powell**: that. Before you can get to another one on this doubling path, you've got to come all the way

[00:05:52] **Randy Powell**: through these other numbers. Only three and six are oscillating back and forth, just like magnetic

[00:05:58] **Randy Powell**: fields, like a pulse, like a representation of duality of opposites in and out, two and throw

[00:06:07] **Randy Powell**: back and forth. That is how the three and six work. We could call them and refer to them as magnetic

[00:06:15] **Randy Powell**: numbers. But how come if they're oscillating back and forth, they're not connected to each other

[00:06:21] **Randy Powell**: by a line? You see there's no line here. In fact, my six has to go up here before it can come back

[00:06:27] **Randy Powell**: down here and stay with my three. They're both connected to the nine. Now I've hesitated to get to

[00:06:32] **Randy Powell**: the nine, and in fact, it's the most important number. We shouldn't say that, maybe we should say

[00:06:39] **Randy Powell**: all the numbers are equally important, but the nine is really the king of the system, or the queen

[00:06:46] **Randy Powell**: of the chess game. It is the control for everything else. So what is the nine? Well, what happens if

[00:06:54] **Randy Powell**: you double nine? Nine double becomes 18. 18 doubled is 36. 36 doubled is 72. So if you add any of

[00:07:10] **Randy Powell**: those numbers together, 18, 36, 72, they always equal nine. What about if I have nine? Half

[00:07:19] **Randy Powell**: of nine is 4.5, which equals nine. Half of 4.5 is 2.25, which equals nine. 5 plus 2 is 7, 7 plus 2 is 9.

[00:07:34] **Randy Powell**: So no matter whether I double or half, the nine is never changing. It's forming an axis here

[00:07:43] **Randy Powell**: that's polarizing all of these numbers, because in this system we're actually able to give polarity

[00:07:50] **Randy Powell**: to numbers. So I've shown you one function here. We've been talking about duh, or two functions you

[00:07:57] **Randy Powell**: could say. We've been talking about doubling. We've been talking about halfing. But let's go back

[00:08:02] **Randy Powell**: a little bit simpler. Let's try to understand before we go to complex and to physics, what are these

[00:08:10] **Randy Powell**: numbers? And what do we mean by the functions of math? Okay? So we'll start simply with multiplication

[00:08:21] **Randy Powell**: tables. All right, let me bring up my next board. Okay, now here I don't have my lines drawn in. I'm

[00:08:33] **Randy Powell**: sorry for the primitive board, but you'll have to bear with me. Here I'm showing you multiplication

[00:08:40] **Randy Powell**: tables. Now we started with my one. Okay, the number one, when you multiply it, what does it do?

[00:08:48] **Randy Powell**: One times two is two. One times three is three. One times four is four, five, six, seven, eight,

[00:09:01] **Randy Powell**: nine. After that I'm simply going to repeat. If I go to 10, one plus zero comes back to one, 11,

[00:09:08] **Randy Powell**: back to two, 12, three, 13, four, 14, five. So no matter how far I multiply when reducing the

[00:09:18] **Randy Powell**: single digits, I'm constantly going to have this pattern. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

[00:09:24] **Randy Powell**: eight, nine. That's the only number that will make that pattern. One is the only multiplication

[00:09:30] **Randy Powell**: series which goes up in increments of one. So it's unique. One of the important things in the

[00:09:36] **Randy Powell**: system to remember is that there's never any redundancy. It's never doing the same thing

[00:09:44] **Randy Powell**: over and over or the same thing twice you could say. Exactly. So one is the only number which goes

[00:09:52] **Randy Powell**: up in increments of one.
