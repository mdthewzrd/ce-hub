# CHAPTER 2: VORTEX MATH REVEALED - THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNIVERSE

## What if I told you that everything you've been taught about mathematics is incomplete?

Not wrong—just incomplete. Like learning to read but never discovering that words can form poetry, or learning notes but never hearing a symphony.

The mathematics we're taught in school focuses on **calculation**—how to manipulate numbers to get results. And that's valuable. It's the foundation of engineering, economics, and science.

But there's another dimension of mathematics that's rarely taught: the dimension of **pattern**.

Not what numbers can do, but what numbers **are**.

Not how to calculate, but how to **recognize**.

Not just quantity, but **quality**.

This chapter introduces you to Vortex Based Mathematics (VBM)—a way of understanding numbers as the fundamental language of the universe. As you'll see, this isn't abstract or mystical. These patterns are demonstrable, verifiable, and they underlie all of reality.

And once you truly see them, you'll never look at mathematics—or the universe—the same way again.

## The Awakening to Numbers

Let me start with a simple question: **What are numbers?**

In school, we're taught that numbers are tools for counting and calculating. We learn:

- **1 + 1 = 2** (addition)
- **2 × 3 = 6** (multiplication)
- **9 ÷ 3 = 3** (division)

And these operations are useful. We use them to balance checkbooks, calculate distances, design bridges, and send rockets to the moon.

But here's what we're not taught:

**Numbers themselves have qualities and relationships that exist independently of what we do with them.**

The number 3 isn't just a count of three things. It's a fundamental principle with specific characteristics. The number 7 isn't just the amount after 6. It has unique properties that make it different from every other number.

Numbers aren't just quantities. **They're the building blocks of reality itself.**

Let me show you what I mean.

---

## The Number Map: A Portrait of Reality

The foundation of Vortex Based Mathematics is something called the **number map**—a simple geometric arrangement of numbers 1 through 9 that reveals hidden patterns.

Imagine a circle. Place the numbers 1 through 9 around it, equally spaced, like this:

```
        1
    9       2
  8           3
    7       4
        6   5
```

This isn't just a way to organize numbers. It's a **map of reality**—a geometric representation of how energy, matter, and consciousness structure themselves.

From this simple arrangement, profound patterns emerge. Let me show you the two most important ones.

---

## The Doubling Circuit: The Binary Expansion

Start at 1. Double it. You get 2.

Now, on the number map, draw a line from 1 to 2.

Next, double 2. You get 4. Draw a line from 2 to 4.

Double 4. You get 8. Draw a line from 4 to 8.

Here's where it gets interesting: **Double 8 and you get 16.** But in Vortex Based Mathematics, we reduce all numbers to a single digit through a process called **digit summing** (adding all digits together).

So for 16: 1 + 6 = 7

Draw a line from 8 to 7.

Continue this pattern:

- Double 7 → 14 → 1 + 4 = 5 (line from 7 to 5)
- Double 5 → 10 → 1 + 0 = 1 (line from 5 back to 1)

The circuit is complete: **1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1**

This is the **doubling circuit**—a continuous loop that repeats infinitely as you continue doubling.

**What does this mean?**

This pattern shows up throughout nature and technology:

- **Cell division** follows doubling patterns
- **Binary code** (the foundation of computers) is based on doubling
- **Musical octaves** double in frequency
- **Electromagnetic waves** follow doubling relationships
- **Crystal structures** form along doubling geometries

The doubling circuit is the pattern of **expansion and manifestation**—how unity (1) expresses itself through increasingly complex forms while always returning to its source.

**This pattern isn't arbitrary. It's fundamental to how the universe creates.**

---

## The Tripling Circuit: The Creative Principle

Now let's explore the tripling circuit. Start at 1 again, but this time multiply by 3.

- 1 × 3 = 3 (line from 1 to 3)
- 3 × 3 = 9 (line from 3 to 9)
- 9 × 3 = 27 → 2 + 7 = 9 (stays at 9)

So the tripling circuit is: **1 → 3 → 9**

And here's the remarkable thing: **Every time you triple 9, you get 9.**

9 × 3 = 27 → 2 + 7 = 9
27 × 3 = 81 → 8 + 1 = 9
81 × 3 = 243 → 2 + 4 + 3 = 9

**Nine is the completion.** The axis around which everything else revolves.

This is what Tesla meant when he said: *"If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe."**

He wasn't speaking metaphorically. He recognized that:

- **3** is the creative force—the spark of manifestation
- **6** is the structure—the form that manifestation takes
- **9** is the completion—the return to unity

The tripling circuit reveals the **creative principle** of the universe—how potential becomes actual.

---

## The Family of Number: How Everything Relates

When you combine the doubling and tripling circuits, you discover something profound: **All numbers are part of one interconnected family.**

The doubling circuit (1-2-4-8-7-5) represents the **expansive principle**—how unity diversifies into form.

The tripling circuit (1-3-9) represents the **creative principle**—how potential manifests.

Together, they form a complete system—a way of understanding how everything relates to everything else.

But here's what's truly remarkable: **These patterns show up throughout nature, at every scale.**

- **Atoms** arrange themselves according to these mathematical principles
- **Molecules** form structures following these geometries
- **Crystals** grow in patterns predicted by VBM
- **Plants** arrange leaves and seeds using these circuits
- **Galaxies** spiral according to these same relationships

The number map isn't just a mathematical curiosity. **It's a portrait of how reality structures itself.**

---

## From Flat Map to 3D Reality: The ABHA Torus

So far, we've been working with a two-dimensional number map—a circle with numbers around it. But here's where Vortex Based Mathematics becomes truly revolutionary.

**What if this 2D map is actually a 2D representation of a 3D object?**

Imagine taking the number map and transforming it into three dimensions. What would it look like?

The answer is the **ABHA Torus**—a donut-shaped geometric form that incorporates all the relationships of the number map into a flowing, dynamic structure.

Here's how to visualize it:

1. **The torus shape** (donut) is the fundamental form
2. **The numbers 1-9** flow along the surface in specific patterns
3. **The doubling circuit** creates one set of spiraling flows
4. **The tripling circuit** creates another set
5. **The 3-6-9 axis** runs through the center, like the spine of the torus

This isn't abstract geometry. **It's the shape that energy takes when it flows in coherent systems.**

Consider where torus shapes appear in nature:

- **Magnetic fields** around planets and stars
- **Smoke rings** and vortex rings in fluids
- **Apples** and other fruits growing around a central core
- **Hurricanes** and tornadoes
- **The human heart**'s electromagnetic field
- **At the atomic scale** in probability clouds

The torus isn't just common in nature—**it's the fundamental shape of energy flow.**

And the ABHA Torus shows how numbers themselves create this shape. It demonstrates that **mathematics and geometry are two perspectives on the same underlying reality.**

---

## Why Tesla's 3-6-9 Matters

Now we can return to Tesla's cryptic statement and understand it more deeply:

*"If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe."**

Tesla wasn't speaking poetically. As an inventor who worked directly with electricity, magnetism, and resonance, he recognized patterns in how energy behaves. And those patterns centered on 3, 6, and 9.

Here's why these numbers matter:

### **Three (3) is the spark of creation**

- It's the first step away from unity (1) through tripling
- It represents the initiation of movement, change, manifestation
- In the number map, 3 is where the tripling circuit begins
- Many natural systems operate in threes (proton-neutron-electron, birth-life-death, past-present-future)

### **Six (6) is the structure of form**

- It's the double of 3, representing how the creative impulse takes form
- In the number map, 6 completes a circuit with 3 and 9
- Hexagonal (six-sided) structures are incredibly stable and common in nature
- The number 6 appears throughout sacred geometry and natural systems

### **Nine (9) is the completion and return**

- It's the triple of 3, representing full manifestation
- When you multiply any number by 9, the result reduces to 9 (9×3=27→2+7=9)
- It's the axis around which the doubling circuit flows
- It represents completion, wholeness, and return to source

**The 3-6-9 axis is the key because it's the bridge between potential and actual, between unity and diversity, between the abstract and the concrete.**

Tesla recognized this. His inventions—the Tesla coil, the Wardenclyffe Tower, his wireless power transmission systems—all embodied 3-6-9 principles.

And when you understand this, you understand why he said these numbers were the key to the universe.

## Marko Rodin's Discovery

Vortex Based Mathematics wasn't developed in a university mathematics department. It was discovered by **Marko Rodin**, a man who wasn't formally trained as a mathematician but who had an extraordinary gift for seeing patterns.

Rodin's story begins in the 1980s, when he became fascinated with the patterns hidden within numbers. While others saw mathematics as a tool for calculation, Rodin saw it as a language—a way of understanding how reality itself is structured.

His key insight was simple but revolutionary:

**The numbers 1 through 9 aren't just counts. They're a complete system—the foundation of all mathematical truth.**

From this insight, Rodin developed:

- **The number map** and its geometric arrangement
- **The doubling and tripling circuits** and their significance
- **The ABHA Torus** as the 3D manifestation of number relationships
- **Practical applications** including coils, flux thrusters, and energy devices

What's remarkable about Rodin's work is that it came from **direct observation rather than academic derivation**. He didn't start with existing mathematical frameworks and try to fit numbers into them. He started with numbers themselves and let them show him their own nature.

This approach is worth considering because:

1. **It bypasses assumptions** that academic mathematics might carry
2. **It's based on direct pattern recognition** rather than theoretical frameworks
3. **It produces results** that can be verified independently
4. **It leads to practical applications** that work

Rodin didn't just describe VBM—he built technologies based on it. The most famous of these is the **Rodin Coil**.

---

## The Rodin Coil: Geometry in Action

The Rodin Coil is a practical application of Vortex Based Mathematics—a wire wound in a specific geometric pattern that creates unusual electromagnetic effects.

Here's how it works:

**Traditional coils** (like those in electromagnets) are wound in simple spirals. They create magnetic fields, but those fields are somewhat chaotic and inefficient.

**Rodin coils** are wound according to VBM principles:

1. **Wire follows number map patterns**—specifically the doubling circuit
2. **The winding creates multiple overlapping fields** that interact in specific ways
3. **The geometry creates coherence**—electromagnetic fields that are more organized
4. **The result is unusual effects** that conventional coils don't produce

These effects include:

- **Greater efficiency** in electromagnetic field generation
- **Coherent field patterns** that extend further than traditional coils
- **Unusual energy characteristics** that researchers are still studying
- **Applications in healing, energy generation, and communications**

The Rodin Coil demonstrates that VBM isn't just theoretical. **It has practical applications that work.**

But more importantly, the coil is **physical proof of the principle**: When you arrange matter according to the mathematical patterns of the universe, you tap into fundamental forces that conventional approaches don't access.

## Randy Powell: The Teacher Who Made VBM Accessible

Marko Rodin's discoveries were groundbreaking, but they weren't immediately accessible to most people. The mathematics was unfamiliar. The concepts were revolutionary. And without a teacher, the number map just looked like...well, numbers arranged in a circle.

Enter **Randy Powell**—the man who would become VBM's most visible and effective teacher.

Powell's background wasn't in mathematics or physics. He was an ordinary person who encountered Rodin's work and recognized something profound. But unlike others who might have appreciated it privately, Powell made a decision:

**He would dedicate his life to making VBM accessible to everyone.**

This decision would transform VBM from a niche discovery to a global movement.

### Powell's Teaching Approach

What makes Powell's approach so effective? Several things:

**1. Step-by-Step Progression**

Powell doesn't dump everything on his students at once. He builds understanding gradually:

- Start with the number map
- Reveal the doubling circuit
- Introduce the tripling circuit
- Show how they create the ABHA Torus
- Demonstrate practical applications

Each step builds on the last, allowing students to have "aha moments" along the way rather than being overwhelmed.

**2. Visual Learning**

VBM is inherently visual, and Powell's teaching honors that:

- Diagrams showing circuits and patterns
- Color-coding for different relationships
- 3D visualizations of the torus
- Real-world examples that illustrate concepts

**3. Pattern Recognition Over Memorization**

Powell doesn't ask students to memorize formulas. Instead, he guides them to recognize patterns:

- "What do you notice happens when we double these numbers?"
- "Where does the pattern lead us?"
- "What does this remind you of in nature?"

This approach creates deeper understanding because students discover principles themselves rather than being told them.

**4. Real-World Applications**

Powell consistently connects abstract patterns to concrete applications:

- Rodin coils and how they're built
- Flux thrusters and what they do
- Energy technologies based on VBM
- Biological systems that follow VBM principles

This grounds the mathematics in reality and shows students why it matters.

### The Global Impact

Powell's teaching has had remarkable effects:

- **Millions of views** on his video presentations
- **Students worldwide** building Rodin coils and conducting experiments
- **Translations** into multiple languages
- **Applications** in fields from engineering to healing
- **A community** of self-directed learners exploring VBM together

What started as one man's attempt to explain complex ideas has become a global education movement.

And perhaps Powell's greatest contribution is this: **He proved that revolutionary knowledge doesn't have to remain locked in academic towers.** It can be shared, understood, and applied by anyone with curiosity and an open mind.

## Practical Applications: From Theory to Technology

Vortex Based Mathematics isn't just an interesting way to look at numbers. **It has practical applications that are being developed and used right now.**

Let me give you some specific examples:

### The Rodin Coil

We've already mentioned this, but let me go deeper. A Rodin Coil is wound according to VBM principles:

1. **Wire follows the doubling circuit pattern**
2. **Multiple layers create overlapping fields**
3. **The geometry creates electromagnetic coherence**
4. **Applications include:**
   - More efficient electromagnetic field generation
   - Wireless power transmission
   - Healing technologies (specific frequency generation)
   - Experimental propulsion systems

### The Flux Thruster

Related to the Rodin Coil, the flux thruster is a device that:

- **Creates directional force** without conventional propellants
- **Uses VBM geometry** to organize electromagnetic fields
- **Demonstrates effects** that conventional physics says shouldn't exist
- **Has applications** in propulsion and energy generation

### Healing Technologies

VBM principles are being applied to health and healing:

- **Frequency generation** devices based on number patterns
- **Bio-field coherence** technologies that follow VBM geometries
- **Water structuring** systems using VBM-informed designs
- **Sound healing** applications based on mathematical harmonics

### Energy Systems

Perhaps the most significant applications are in energy generation:

- **Coherent energy extraction** from zero-point fields
- **Plasmoid generation** systems like the Thunderstorm Generator
- **Electromagnetic harvesting** technologies
- **Transmutation systems** that transform elements

### What Makes These Applications Possible?

The key insight is this: **When you organize matter and energy according to the mathematical patterns of the universe, you access capabilities that conventional approaches don't.**

It's like the difference between random noise and coherent music. Both use the same notes, but the organization makes all the difference.

VBM provides the sheet music for arranging energy in coherent, effective ways.

---

## The Mathematics of Creation

Let me step back and offer a broader perspective on what we've been exploring.

**Vortex Based Mathematics isn't just a different way to do calculations. It's a recognition that mathematics is the language of creation itself.**

Consider what this means:

**1. Mathematics isn't a human invention**

We didn't invent numbers or their relationships. We discovered them. They exist independently of us, governing the structure of reality.

**2. Patterns in mathematics reflect patterns in nature**

The doubling circuit shows up in cells, crystals, and galaxies because the same mathematical principle structures all of them.

**3. Geometry is mathematics made visible**

The ABHA Torus isn't just a shape—it's the geometric expression of number relationships.

**4. Energy follows mathematical pathways**

When energy flows in coherent systems (from atoms to galaxies), it follows VBM patterns.

**5. Consciousness can recognize these patterns**

We're not separate from the mathematics we study. We're part of the pattern, capable of recognizing it because we embody it.

This perspective transforms mathematics from a dry, abstract subject into **the key to understanding how reality works.**

And that's exactly what Tesla meant when he called 3-6-9 the key to the universe.

## Seeing the Patterns Yourself

Everything I've described so far might sound interesting, but perhaps theoretical. So let me offer you something practical:

**You can verify these patterns yourself.**

You don't need special equipment or advanced training. You need:

- Paper and pencil
- A calculator (optional)
- Curiosity
- Willingness to see for yourself

### Exercise 1: The Doubling Circuit

Start with 1. Keep doubling it. Reduce each result to a single digit by adding all the digits together.

- 1 → 1
- 1 × 2 = 2 → 2
- 2 × 2 = 4 → 4
- 4 × 2 = 8 → 8
- 8 × 2 = 16 → 1+6=7 → 7
- 7 × 2 = 14 → 1+4=5 → 5
- 5 × 2 = 10 → 1+0=1 → back to 1

See the pattern? 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1

This pattern repeats infinitely. It's a closed loop. It never varies.

### Exercise 2: The Tripling Circuit

Now try tripling:

- 1 → 1
- 1 × 3 = 3 → 3
- 3 × 3 = 9 → 9
- 9 × 3 = 27 → 2+7=9 → stays at 9

No matter how many times you triple 9, you always get 9. Try it:

- 9 × 3 = 27 → 9
- 27 × 3 = 81 → 8+1=9
- 81 × 3 = 243 → 2+4+3=9
- 243 × 3 = 729 → 7+2+9=18 → 1+8=9

Nine is the completion, the axis, the constant.

### Exercise 3: Create the Number Map

Draw a circle. Place the numbers 1-9 around it, equally spaced. Then:

- Draw the doubling circuit (1→2→4→8→7→5→1) in one color
- Draw the tripling circuit (1→3→9) in another color

What you've drawn isn't just a diagram. It's a **map of reality**—a geometric representation of how energy, matter, and consciousness structure themselves.

### Exercise 4: Find These Patterns in Nature

Once you recognize the patterns, start looking for them:

- **Where do you see spirals** in nature? (Sunflowers, shells, galaxies)
- **Where do you see torus shapes**? (Apples, magnetic fields, smoke rings)
- **Where do you see doubling patterns**? (Cell division, musical octaves)
- **Where do you see tripling**? (Structures built around threes)

The more you look, the more you'll find. **These patterns are everywhere.**

---

## Common Questions and Objections

As you explore Vortex Based Mathematics, you may encounter some common questions and objections. Let me address several:

### "Isn't this just numerology?"

Numerology typically involves assigning mystical significance to numbers without a coherent framework.

VBM is different because:

- **It's based on verifiable mathematical patterns** that anyone can test
- **It produces practical applications** that work (coils, flux thrusters, etc.)
- **It connects to observable phenomena** in nature and technology
- **It has geometric representations** (the ABHA Torus) that can be modeled

This isn't about believing in magical properties of numbers. **It's about recognizing patterns that exist.**

### "Why hasn't mainstream mathematics embraced this?"

Several reasons:

- **Paradigm inertia**: Mathematics departments are invested in existing frameworks
- **Lack of academic publication**: VBM hasn't been published in mainstream journals
- **Origin outside academia**: Rodin and Powell weren't academics, so their work was dismissed
- **Requires different approach**: VBM is about pattern, not proof—theorems and axioms

But here's the thing: **Mathematics doesn't require mainstream acceptance to be true.** The patterns exist whether they're recognized or not.

### "Where's the scientific proof?"

VBM sits in an interesting position:

- **Mathematical patterns** are provable through direct calculation (as shown in the exercises above)
- **Geometric relationships** are demonstrable through modeling
- **Practical applications** (coils, flux thrusters) produce measurable effects
- **Full scientific validation** requires more research by independent laboratories

What we have is a spectrum of evidence—from mathematical proof (which anyone can verify) to experimental validation (which is ongoing). The question isn't "Is there any proof?" but rather **"How much proof do you require before you're willing to explore further?"**

### "Can this really be used for free energy?"

Here's what we know:

- Technologies based on VBM principles exist and are being demonstrated
- Some of these technologies show anomalous energy outputs
- Independent researchers are verifying and replicating results
- Full commercial development is still in early stages

The potential is real. The timeline for public availability is unclear. But **the direction is promising.**

---

## The Deeper Meaning: Mathematics as Sacred

Up to this point, I've focused on the practical, verifiable aspects of Vortex Based Mathematics. But there's a deeper dimension worth exploring:

**If mathematics structures reality, and if those structures reflect intelligent design, then mathematics is sacred.**

Not sacred in a religious sense, but in the sense of being worthy of reverence, respect, and deep contemplation.

Consider:

**1. Mathematical patterns are universal**

They exist everywhere, at every scale, from atoms to galaxies. They're the same patterns that structure quantum mechanics and celestial mechanics.

**2. Mathematical patterns are timeless**

They existed before humans discovered them and will exist after we're gone. They're not dependent on us.

**3. Mathematical patterns are beautiful**

The symmetries, the proportions, the relationships—there's an elegance to mathematics that has inspired scientists and artists throughout history.

**4. Mathematical patterns are meaningful**

They're not random or arbitrary. They reflect principles of organization that make the universe coherent and comprehensible.

When you recognize these qualities, mathematics stops being a dry subject and becomes **a window into the mind that created reality.**

This doesn't require religious belief. It requires **reverence for the intelligence inherent in existence itself.**

---

## Integrating VBM into Your Understanding

As we conclude this chapter, you might be wondering: "How do I integrate this into my life and understanding?"

Here are some suggestions:

### 1. Play with the Patterns

Don't just read about VBM—**experience it**:

- Draw the number map yourself
- Do the doubling and tripling exercises
- Build physical models if you're inclined
- Look for these patterns in nature

The understanding that comes from direct experience is deeper than what comes from reading alone.

### 2. Connect to Other Knowledge

VBM doesn't exist in isolation. It connects to:

- **Sacred geometry** (which we'll explore in Chapter 3)
- **Unified field theory** (Chapter 4)
- **Healing applications** (Chapter 5)
- **Ancient wisdom** (Chapter 6)

Each connection deepens your understanding of the others.

### 3. Notice Resistance

You may feel resistance to these ideas. That's normal.

We're taught to dismiss things that don't fit our current understanding. But **growth happens at the edge of our comfort zone.**

Notice your resistance, examine it, and then decide whether it's serving you or limiting you.

### 4. Share What You Discover

Knowledge grows when shared:

- Teach someone else the doubling circuit
- Show a child the number map
- Discuss these concepts with curious friends
- Share resources and discoveries

The act of teaching deepens your own understanding.

### 5. Stay Grounded

VBM can be mind-expanding. Stay grounded by:

- Verifying claims through your own investigation
- Maintaining critical thinking along with openness
- Connecting abstract concepts to concrete reality
- Balancing exploration with practical responsibilities
