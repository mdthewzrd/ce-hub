**Resolution**:
- Minimum: 300 DPI at print size
- Preferred: 600 DPI for flexibility
- Test: Print at 100% to check quality

**Color Space**:
- RGB: For digital/ebook versions
- CMYK: For print (convert at final stage)
- Profile: sRGB (RGB), GRACoL/SWOP (CMYK)

**File Formats**:
- **Source/Editable**: AI, EPS, SVG, PSD, Blend (preserve layers)
- **Print Ready**: TIFF (lossless), PDF (for vector)
- **Digital/Web**: PNG (lossless), JPEG (for photos only)

**File Size**:
- Vector: Typically 1-10 MB
- Raster: 5-50 MB depending on dimensions
- Compress: Use lossless for archival, appropriate compression for delivery

### Scientific Accuracy

**Verification Process**:
1. Consult primary sources (research papers, expert descriptions)
2. Cross-reference multiple sources
3. Have subject matter expert review where possible
4. Cite sources in figure captions

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Fibonacci spirals that aren't actually golden (common error)
- Chakra positions that don't match traditional locations
- Frequency ranges that are linear instead of logarithmic
- Sacred geometry with imperfect proportions

### Consistency Standards

**Visual Style**:
- Consistent color palette across all illustrations
- Unified line weights and styles
- Similar typography for labels and annotations
- Coherent aesthetic (scientific vs. artistic vs. educational)

**Labeling Convention**:
- Font: Sans-serif for readability (Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans)
- Size: Minimum 8pt at print size
- Color: High contrast against background
- Placement: Consistent position (e.g., bottom-right of each image)

### Legal and Ethical Standards

**Rights Management**:
- [ ] Obtain usage rights documentation for all licensed images
- [ ] Save model releases if applicable
- [ ] Track attribution requirements for Creative Commons
- [ ] Verify commercial use permissions (educational ≠ commercial)

**Credit System**:
- Create consistent credit format
- Include in figure captions or back matter
- Example: "V1 Number Map: Created by [Name] based on Rodin VBM"

**Fair Use Considerations**:
- Educational purpose favors fair use
- Transformative use (adding overlays, annotations)
- Small portion of original work
- No market harm to copyright holder
- **Disclaimer**: When in doubt, consult IP attorney
