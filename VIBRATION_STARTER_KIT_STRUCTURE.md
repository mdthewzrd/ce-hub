## COPYWRITING GUIDELINES

### Voice & Tone

**Approachable but Authoritative**
- Not academic, but not woo-woo either
- "Here's what the research shows" not "This magical frequency"
- Balance curiosity with credibility

**Pattern:**
1. Acknowledge the mystery/wonder
2. Ground in research/science
3. Give practical application
4. Invite exploration

### Writing Principles

1. **Short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
2. **Bulleted lists** for easy scanning
3. **Bold key terms** for emphasis
4. **Clear CTAs** with buttons
5. **Mobile-first** (most will view on phone)

### Headline Formula

**For Videos**: "X-minute [Topic] (Promise)"

Examples:
- "8-minute Guide to 432Hz"
- "12-minute Sound Healing Explained"

**For Sections**: "Promise + Timeframe + Benefit"

Examples:
- "Master Vibration Basics (47 minutes)"
- "Get Your Free Cheat Sheet"
