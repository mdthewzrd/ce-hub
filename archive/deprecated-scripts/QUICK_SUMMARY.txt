FRONTEND INTEGRATION STATUS - QUICK SUMMARY
============================================

PROJECT: Edge Dev Backend Standardization
DATE: November 4, 2025
INTEGRATION LEVEL: 35% (Critical Gaps)

CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================

1. FIELD MAPPING MISMATCH (P1)
   Issue: Backend returns gap_pct, parabolic_score
          Frontend expects gapPercent, score
   Impact: Results display incorrectly
   Status: BLOCKING
   File: /src/app/page.tsx:2431-2432
   
2. UPLOAD NOT INTEGRATED (P1) 
   Issue: Upload handler formats code but never sends to backend
   Impact: Custom scanners don't execute
   Status: BLOCKING
   File: /src/app/page.tsx:1588-1711
   
3. TYPE DEFINITION CONFLICT (P2)
   Issue: Two conflicting ScanResult interfaces (legacy + new)
   Impact: Code confusion, potential undefined errors
   Status: HIGH PRIORITY
   File: /src/types/scanTypes.ts
   
4. MISSING DISPLAY FIELDS (P2)
   Issue: Only 5/8+ standardized fields shown
   Impact: Users can't see quality metrics
   Status: HIGH PRIORITY
   File: /src/app/page.tsx:2402-2437

BACKEND STATUS: 95% READY
==========================
✓ Universal Scanner Engine implemented
✓ All endpoints properly defined
✓ Standardized result format ready
✓ Upload code path exists
✓ Deduplication working

FRONTEND STATUS: 35% READY
===========================
✓ API service layer correct (85%)
✓ Basic scan execution works
✓ Upload UI ready
✗ Upload doesn't call backend (0%)
✗ Field mapping wrong (0%)
✗ Display missing fields (40%)
✗ Type definitions conflicted (60%)

KEY MISMATCHES
==============

Backend sends:           Frontend expects:
gap_pct                 gapPercent ❌
parabolic_score         score ❌
lc_frontside_d2_...     (not displayed) ❌
confidence_score        (not displayed) ❌
close                   (not displayed) ❌

API ENDPOINTS
=============

Backend Ready:
  POST /api/scan/execute           (line 345 main.py)
  GET /api/scan/status/{scan_id}   (line 592)
  GET /api/scan/results/{scan_id}  (line 600)

Frontend Calling:
  POST http://localhost:8000/api/scan/execute  ✓
  GET http://localhost:8000/api/scan/status/{id} ✓

Upload Path Ready:
  Backend: if uploaded_code: execute_universal_scan() ✓
  Frontend: NEVER SENDS uploaded_code ❌

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
===========================

1. Fix Field References (1 hour)
   File: /src/app/page.tsx
   Change:
     result.gapPercent → result.gap_pct
     result.score → result.parabolic_score
   
2. Implement Upload Backend Call (1-2 hours)
   File: /src/app/page.tsx:1700+
   Add: POST /api/scan/execute with uploaded_code
   
3. Unify Type Definitions (30 min)
   File: /src/types/scanTypes.ts
   Remove legacy ScanResult, use new fields
   
4. Add Missing Display Columns (1 hour)
   File: /src/app/page.tsx
   Add: lc_frontside_d2_extended, confidence_score, close

TIMELINE
========

Phase 1 (Critical): 3-4 hours
  - Field mapping
  - Upload integration
  - Type unification

Phase 2 (High): 4-5 hours
  - Additional display fields
  - Statistics panel updates
  - Legacy route cleanup

Phase 3 (Nice): 6-8 hours
  - Filters
  - Export
  - Comparison features

TOTAL TO PRODUCTION: ~2 weeks

FILES TO UPDATE
===============

Priority 1 (Today):
  /src/app/page.tsx - Main component
  /src/types/scanTypes.ts - Type definitions

Priority 2 (This Sprint):
  /src/services/fastApiScanService.ts - Verify correct
  /src/app/api/systematic/scan/route.ts - Deprecate/redirect
  
Verification:
  /backend/main.py - No changes needed ✓
  /backend/universal_scanner_engine.py - No changes ✓

TESTING
=======

Before Integration:
  [ ] Verify backend returns correct field names
  [ ] Test upload sends to backend
  [ ] Check result display mapping
  [ ] Verify all fields render
  
After Integration:
  [ ] LC scan results display correctly
  [ ] Upload scan results display correctly
  [ ] Statistics calculations accurate
  [ ] No undefined field errors
