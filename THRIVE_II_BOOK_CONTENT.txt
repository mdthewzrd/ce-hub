CHAPTER 1: UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE (Vibration, Frequency)
====================================================================================================

KEY CONCEPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:00:28] up of trillions of atoms
[00:00:31] and what are the atoms made up of
[00:00:39] of energy
[00:01:24] in a field of energy tapping guidance
[00:02:00] it's based on an understanding of energy
[00:02:10] organized energy
[00:02:23] a universal fabric of energy that
[00:03:11] energy and how to relate to it
[00:03:58] schemes to the suppression of new energy
[00:04:43] free energy
[00:06:33] where does the energy of a magnet come
[00:06:35] from where does the energy of a
[00:06:36] nuclei of an atom that's spinning at
[00:06:41] where does that energy come from i
[00:07:31] the phenomenon of accessing energy from
[00:08:21] smaller than the atom
[00:08:50] energy from the ubiquium it's all
[00:08:54] here it's right here that energy is here
[00:09:01] the background energy
[00:09:19] that's extracting energy from the
[00:09:27] to create a resonance link
[00:09:47] to achieve high level of resonance
[00:10:04] energy from the unified field
[00:12:03] to me resonance represents the new world
[00:12:10] given how centralized energy can be used
[00:12:17] corporations are extracting energy
[00:12:31] energy but that energy is always
[00:12:35] moving that movement is called vibration
[00:12:39] and frequency is the rate at which it's
[00:12:52] resonance

CHAPTER 2: VORTEX MATH (Patterns, Torus, Rodin Coils)
====================================================================================================

KEY CONCEPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:04:14] the patterns we highlighted are even
[00:06:48] consistent relatable mathematics
[00:10:12] this device is built out of two coils
[00:10:38] inside the coil is a crystal container
[00:10:50] as we power up the coil so
[00:11:12] open the coil remove that that becomes
[00:13:12] and woven into predictable patterns
[00:14:02] pattern so when we see energy
[00:15:13] in design this is because the torus
[00:15:17] is the basic pattern that energy takes
[00:19:29] field of infinitesimal spinning toruses
[00:19:35] concentrations of toruses
[00:22:04] nested hierarchy there is one pattern at
[00:23:10] pattern
[00:23:19] this pattern is identical to what we are
[00:25:20] predictable patterns
[00:43:42] patterns in this part of the body
[00:46:16] organization it has a pattern to it
[00:47:52] predictable principles and patterns
[01:04:21] by looking at mathematics and music
[01:06:50] circuit so that it can go through your
[01:07:18] completes the circuit but it comes
[01:14:26] in a pressurized vortex to access

====================================================================================================
CHAPTER 3: SACRED PATTERNS (Fibonacci, Phi, Nature)
====================================================================================================

KEY CONCEPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:00:52] so my essential nature by definition
[00:10:16] a magnetic field in the geometry of a
[00:11:04] geometry in the plasma inside the
[00:11:32] or when it builds a galaxy
[00:11:59] we can explore galaxy and maybe even
[00:12:17] corporations are extracting energy
[00:13:55] consideration what they're telling us
[00:14:12] defined by the geometry of
[00:14:20] geometry is not just points lines and
[00:14:57] replicable technologies the geometry is
[00:25:08] nature
[00:26:36] signature
[00:36:22] energetic signature that can be matched
[00:38:35] signatures of the deficient minerals or
[00:48:10] nature
[00:51:53] philosophers and shamans we met
[00:52:13] for such far-reaching inspirations as
[00:58:05] sacred ceremony
[01:04:54] mathematical nature of the cosmos
[01:07:51] of them is generation of energy
[01:08:00] integration of energy how to get it into
[01:08:07] found in the area of integration
[01:12:29] these innovations in energy integration
[01:13:04] breakthroughs in the generation of
[01:20:04] it was good corroboration that they
[01:22:15] is we do the duration test so we find
[01:26:33] duration test that we need
[01:38:47] a universal banking corporation to rule
[01:39:12] consequences under
[01:40:17] there's both a rational and a moral
[01:42:11] nature of violence which is one of the
[01:52:44] nature
[01:56:03] under the golden shield program
[01:56:47] cooperation and
[01:59:23] legal rights for nature it would
[02:02:16] an ancient confederation of royal
[02:02:19] japan indonesia the philippines
[02:05:30] governments and corporations
[02:05:41] pedophilia rings and stop
[02:09:56] unethical policies instead of rational
[02:16:59] just hope destructive corporations will
[02:17:10] some of these corporations need to be
[02:17:42] that corporations can have the same
[02:20:02] corporations hotels schools

CHAPTER 4: UNIFIED FIELD (Everything Connected, Tesla)
====================================================================================================

KEY CONCEPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:00:39] of energy
[00:01:24] in a field of energy tapping guidance
[00:01:42] together
[00:02:00] it's based on an understanding of energy
[00:02:10] organized energy
[00:02:16] the unified field
[00:02:23] a universal fabric of energy that
[00:02:40] has changed radically newton's universe
[00:02:57] looking at our cosmos as a connected
[00:02:59] field
[00:03:11] energy and how to relate to it
[00:03:49] we connected the dots among seemingly
[00:03:58] schemes to the suppression of new energy
[00:04:43] free energy
[00:04:44] clean abundant electricity source
[00:04:58] so we put together teams of engineers
[00:06:24] fundamental field that they're baiting
[00:06:30] this unified field can begin to explain
[00:06:33] where does the energy of a magnet come
[00:06:35] from where does the energy of a
[00:06:41] where does that energy come from i
[00:06:45] true unified theory that is backed by
[00:07:00] all those things kind of come together
[00:07:28] i've been studying the unified field and
[00:07:31] the phenomenon of accessing energy from
[00:07:44] physics of how the universe works
[00:08:32] it's a source of the gravitational field
[00:08:36] field it's a source of mass
[00:08:50] energy from the ubiquium it's all
[00:08:54] here it's right here that energy is here
[00:09:01] the background energy
[00:09:19] that's extracting energy from the
[00:09:22] fundamental field
[00:09:30] to this fundamental field
[00:09:51] to the fundamental quantum field that's
[00:10:04] energy from the unified field
[00:10:23] that field in coordinated rotation
[00:10:48] electromagnetic field structure
[00:11:04] field
[00:11:27] basically mimic what the universe does

CHAPTER 5: HEALING THROUGH HARMONY
====================================================================================================

KEY CONCEPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:00:16] i used to think that i was my body
[00:00:19] but if i look deeper my body is made up
[00:00:22] of trillions of cells
[00:00:46] my body has been replaced
[00:01:06] when my physical body tires out and goes
[00:01:28] and then bringing that into this body
[00:04:01] holistic healing and ufo phenomena
[00:04:40] everything from cure cancer to access
[00:11:22] while making you healthy
[00:22:28] within cells
[00:24:31] developing healing technologies
[00:27:38] health
[00:27:51] gives us a way to come into harmony with
[00:30:26] health wants many things
[00:30:32] being healthy is not just a personal
[00:30:59] to promote healing according to quantum
[00:31:27] and health
[00:31:54] health to me is clear communication
[00:32:05] in each of our trillions of cells every
[00:32:32] physical body and that led to the
[00:32:38] chemicals to affect our body
[00:33:37] goal is healing
[00:33:41] health innovators who i met
[00:33:43] related to the body with respect and to
[00:33:50] body telling us is out of order
[00:34:13] medicine it's good for all kinds of
[00:35:09] on health care than any other nation in
[00:35:40] elicit powerful healing effects
[00:35:52] the cells are always vibrating in a
[00:36:13] cells

CHAPTER 6: HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT
====================================================================================================

KEY CONCEPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:03:53] from an ancient cosmic code to
[00:32:27] as well as an invisible realm in a
[01:03:17] science spirituality and ancient wisdom
[01:12:54] daily lives of all of us everywhere on
[01:13:14] it's essentially everywhere the key to
[01:14:56] they found the secret of how to catalyze
[01:19:42] safe and to keep this knowledge safe
[01:32:26] to try to get his secrets
[01:42:57] and obviously that's
[01:57:01] avoid this same rollout everywhere
[01:58:08] everywhere there's a problem there are
[02:07:52] or mentioning the obvious role of the
[02:08:42] ways to address our obvious need to

NARRATIVE FLOW & STORY STRUCTURE
====================================================================================================

INTRODUCTION (First 5 minutes):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:00:08] a major turning point in my life
[00:00:11] was when i stopped being afraid of dying
[00:00:16] i used to think that i was my body
[00:00:19] but if i look deeper my body is made up
[00:00:22] of trillions of cells
[00:00:25] and if i keep looking deeper it's made
[00:00:28] up of trillions of atoms
[00:00:31] and what are the atoms made up of
[00:00:34] nothing they're just whirlpools in a sea
[00:00:39] of energy
[00:00:40] and those aren't things at all
[00:00:44] science tells me virtually every cell in
[00:00:46] my body has been replaced
[00:00:49] but foster's been here all along
[00:00:52] so my essential nature by definition
[00:00:56] by logic must be metaphysical
[00:01:02] so if i'm metaphysical who says that i
[00:01:05] die
[00:01:06] when my physical body tires out and goes
[00:01:10] away
[00:01:17] that's not only an intellectual
[00:01:19] understanding for me it was an
[00:01:21] experience that i'm actually an antenna
[00:01:24] in a field of energy tapping guidance
[00:01:27] from it
[00:01:28] and then bringing that into this body
[00:01:30] and into this physical world
[00:01:32] to fulfill my purpose
[00:01:36] this is where science and spirit
[00:01:39] physics and metaphysics all came
[00:01:42] together
[00:01:42] and fueled my journey of exploring the
[00:01:45] innovations
[00:01:46] and the technologies that reflect this
[00:01:52] understanding this
[00:01:54] blending of science and metaphysics has
[00:01:57] been a key topic in our lives for years
[00:02:00] it's based on an understanding of energy
[00:02:03] how it moves and interacts in the cosmos
[00:02:07] believe this interactive web of
[00:02:10] organized energy
[00:02:12] is exactly what albert einstein was
[00:02:14] seeking but never found
[00:02:16] the unified field
[00:02:22] [Music]
[00:02:23] a universal fabric of energy that
[00:02:26] connects
[00:02:26] all life
[00:02:33] the scientific story we've lived with
[00:02:35] for the past


MAJOR NARRATIVE TRANSITIONS:

CONCLUSION & FINAL MESSAGE
====================================================================================================

[02:22:08] that is at the root of them all aligning
[02:22:11] with the unified field
[02:22:13] can lead to an experience of resonance
[02:22:16] that we call
[02:22:16] love not a romantic crush kind of love
[02:22:20] but the big love coming into harmony
[02:22:23] with the life force itself
[02:22:26] applying reason and practice to
[02:22:29] unleashing our spiritual essence
[02:22:31] is what i call the science of love a
[02:22:34] finite set of skills
[02:22:36] to access this state of harmony these
[02:22:39] skills are physical
[02:22:41] emotional mental and interpersonal
[02:22:46] and it's possible to get good enough at
[02:22:48] each of them
[02:22:49] to experience a deeply fulfilling and
[02:22:52] effective life
[02:22:54] i believe these skills are not only
[02:22:56] obtainable
[02:22:58] but in fact evolving new abilities is
[02:23:00] ordained in our evolutionary code
[02:23:05] so what does it take a clear destination
[02:23:11] freedom a map of how to get there
[02:23:16] the arc of process
[02:23:20] a compass the non-aggression principle
[02:23:26] and a strategy
[02:23:29] restoring wholeness to natural systems
[02:23:33] aligning with the field
[02:23:36] [Music]
[02:23:38] we were born to do this we were born to
[02:23:42] thrive
[02:23:44] the same way there's no magic pill that
[02:23:47] can cure us
[02:23:48] if we don't deal with our lifestyle
[02:23:51] i don't believe there's any one person
[02:23:53] or group
[02:23:54] let alone some marvel superhero who can
[02:23:57] solve all our problems
[02:23:59] i just don't think we can outsource that
[02:24:02] capacity
[02:24:03] so what it means is that we're all in
[02:24:06] charge of coming up with this stuff
[02:24:08] ourselves
[02:24:09] and as daunting as it can feel it's
[02:24:12] actually good news
[02:24:14] because if it weren't up to us we'd be
[02:24:17] powerless
[02:24:18] and we're not we are as powerful as we
[02:24:23] allow ourselves to be
[02:24:26] we're not alone in this we are
[02:24:29] profoundly connected
[02:24:31] science and spirit both show that now
[02:24:35] and as the poet rumi reminds us
[02:24:38] remember you're not just a drop in the
[02:24:41] ocean
[02:24:42] you're the ocean in a drought
[02:24:56] [Music]
[02:25:03] [Music]
[02:25:22] [Music]
[02:25:28] [Music]
[02:25:36] uh
[02:25:39] [Music]
[02:26:01] repeating the earth is speaking
[02:26:05] saying time has come to wake
[02:26:08] up from this nightmare of lives
[02:26:14] so many shattered lives reaching out
[02:26:18] crying
[02:26:29] [Music]
[02:26:46] there's a
[02:26:47] [Music]
[02:27:13] beneath the noise there's an
[02:27:16] inner voice
[02:27:19] [Music]
[02:27:24] the veils are finally lifting
